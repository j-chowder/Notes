#### The Intergenerational Impact of Trauma

* Precious Auntie's own trauma from the tragedies of her life
	* becoming overly superstitious
		* influences Luling's own beliefs in ghosts and curses.
	* lead to her own suicide --> no reason to live.
* Luling experiences trauma from her childhood in China
	* Death of Kai Jing from war.
	* Regret from her treatment towards Precious Auntie

* These traumatic events impact her ability to connect with Ruth emotionally, leading to misunderstandings between them.
	* Overly oppressively, controlling, and critical --> leads to Ruth's bad memories revolving her childhood and the still disjointed mother-and-daughter relationship.

				* Watching "Oz" and moving to San Francisco.
			* the instance of the bead necklace -- different cultures that can't communicate properly
				* Ruth was being truthful, Luling interpreted as being modest.
			* Using the diary to vent her inner emotions instead of voicing them --> which leads to Luling's suicide attempt, only further encouraging Ruth to bottle up her deepest emotions within her more and more.
		* relationship with Art
			* being a pushover and putting herself second. Being a doormat for others to walk over her.
			* inability to fully express her emotions and needs, especially in her marriage, reflects her broader struggles with self-expression.

#### Memory of the past as a Means of Resilience.

LuLing finds a form of resilience through memory 
* LuLing does not properly communicate her trauma with Ruth; she keeps it bottled up. 

* The act of writing down her memories of the past allows her to reclaim her voice and confront her trauma. It is also an attempt to connect with Ruth and to tell about her past.

* Not being able to specifically remember the bad things that she did to Ruth (a loss of memory) while it still haunts Ruth
	* 
Ruth reads about her family's past through LuLing's memories

* Ruth’s initial difficulty in understanding her mother’s silence and emotional distance is tied to her own lack of knowledge about LuLing’s past. However, as Ruth begins to uncover more about her mother’s memories, particularly through the manuscript, she is able to reframe her own struggles and understand the reasons behind her mother’s behavior.

* Ruth’s process of remembering and reinterpreting her family’s history becomes a key part of her resilience. By confronting these memories and learning to integrate them into her own life story, Ruth gains emotional strength and a deeper understanding of herself and her relationship with LuLing.

Memory for reconciliation of the relationship

*  At first, their inability to communicate leads to emotional distance, but as Ruth starts to understand the importance of memory and storytelling in her mother's life, their bond begins to mend. LuLing’s memories, once seen as painful and burdensome, become the foundation for connection and reconciliation.
	* Ruth understanding the significance of her Chinese name.
