#### Identity 

*Yozo’s lost sense of self and attempts to mask his true identity alienate him from the rest of society.*

Oba Yozo is disconnected from people and society. He doesn't understand societal norms and people in general. 
*  Because he doesn't understand, he is afraid. 
Yozo was sexually abused by his family's servants as a child.
* Becomes suspicious and distrusting of other people.
* Assumes everyone has an ulterior motive.

Yozo presents a cheerful and boisterous persona to the world, effectively hiding his true feelings of alienation and despair behind a mask of laughter and social engagement. 
* Puts on a mask -- the role of a "clown" which signs the downfall of his life.

It consumes and overrides Yozo's personality and identity. His actual thoughts and feelings get internalized. Having to put on a new persona of the fool to achieve any kind of warmth from others, which further alienates one self when it isn't the authentic you that's valued, but the mask.

* Cite father asking what souvenir to bring him from Tokyo.
	* He doesn't say anything because he doesn't know what response would be funny or acceptable. Father suggests lion mask --> so Yozo agrees to that because he thinks that’s what his father wants him to want.

Yozo panicks when his mask is penetrated.

* Cite Takeichi saying "you did it on purpose" when Yozo purposely falls over at school to act goofy and make others laugh.
* Yozo is terrified that Takeichi will reveal his secret, so he befriends him to prevent it.


 Yozo's act and lies are for him the only way to stay in the world, pretending to be a human being, and due to not being able to fit into society and feeling immense shame and not being able to share his pain, he lives a debased life, stealing which even he is aware of, trying to escape pain with drinking.

#### Community / Society

*Community dictates who we are as a person and our understanding of the world*

Yozo has to set up a "clown" persona to be accepted and fit into society. 

Throughout the book, Yozo longs for belonging. Through his clownery, through his multiple romantic relationships.

Yozo finally realizes he is a failure of a human when the community puts him into a mental institution.
* He commits crimes, he steals clothes and money from women, and he has been alienated all his life.
* Not doing anything when Yoshiko is getting raped.

#### Trust

*That trust can be a virtue, but ultimately can be a sin.*

Yozo considers Yoshiko the 'personification of trust'

* 17 year old naive girl, virgin.
* Makes a promise with Yozo that if he quits alcohol, he can marry her. Pinky promise. 
	* Yozo breaks it, confesses, but Yoshiko has complete faith that he's "just joshing" and that he would never break a promise.

Yozo was someone who didn't trust people and Yoshiko's trust in others was refreshing for him, that's what he liked about her.

* Yoshiko gets raped due to trusting an acquaintance. 
	* After, she doesn't trust people anymore.
	* She doesn't "trust" Yozo anymore either, even become anxious around Yozo, uncertain about his reaction.

Yoshiko's trust was something he clung at and maybe even gave him a little hope in this world but it was gone. 

#### Value of Money

*When money becomes the primary focus in someone's life, it can lead to a profound sense of alienation and detachment from human values*

Prioritization of wealth and money over genuine connection.

* The money is used to fund his addictions to cope with pain and misery. Morphine  + alcohol.
	* He begs his family for money. He begs various females throughout the novel for money. He steals and pawns off most of his goods for money.

* Tsuneko embodies poverty -- and the unhappiness that stems from it. She bonds and forms a connection with Yozo due to sharing unhappiness in life.
	* Hence forms a suicide pact.

#### Escaping Depression/Reality/Loneliness

*self-destructive spirals -- substance abuse, alcoholism, affairs, suicide -- to coping with depression*

He has many lovers, but feels utterly alone.
* He blames women for everything bad that happens in his life 

Tsuneko (Husband in jail) is as sad as him. Bonds over unhappiness. Forms suicide pact with Yozo. 
* Someone who understands Yozo commits suicide due to sharing similar depressing thoughts about life.

Shizuko (Widow) is affectionate towards Yozo as someone that longs for acceptance, human connection, and love.
* Yozo leaves due to daughter asking him for her real father + seeing Shizuko and daughter happy together.
	* He realizes he is ruining their lives, he would steal money and even clothes/things from that journalist to go sell it for money and to go drink.

Yoshiko
* already mentioned. 

Addiction to alcohol due to independence of adulthood.
* downward spiral --> alcoholism --> spending all money on alcohol -> unhappiness.

Addicted to morphine.
