### Faith (Religious & Trust)

Faith is a source of hope and comfort in harsh times (or when powerless)
* Klara's unwavering faith to the sun 
	* stems from her ignorance and naivete.
		* Beggar Man incident (where Klara thinks Sun helps him when in reality he just wakes up.)
* Irony of robot (who is factual, intelligent, and objective) holding a primitive and irrational faith. 

* This is all amidst Josie's sickness and declining health.
	* All the characters are depressed, on the verge of giving up, and powerless.

	* Klara and her faith serves as a catalyst for the other characters - Paul and Rick - to "contribute" to healing Josie. 
		* Rick carries Klara to the Barn
		* Paul helps Klara vandalize Cootings Machine

	* Chrissie is a downer who has plans to replace Josie with Klara.
		* She juxtaposes Klara's optimism and hope.
