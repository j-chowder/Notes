### Isolation // Social Alienation

* Social Alienation causes evil, resentment, and backlash towards the society that rejected.

Ex:
* Creature instantly rejected by Frankenstein 
* Creature continues to be rejected, shunned, and prejudiced due to its hideous appearance.
* De Lacey Family
	* Creature helps the De Lacey family with chores (shows that he is generous and kind)
	* Being rejected extinguishes hopes of forming human connections -- driving him to focus on revenge.
		* Burns down the house after the family rejects him.
* Saving the drowning girl
	* Men who were with her attack The Creature (shoot him).
* William's murder stems from a culmination of the Monster's rage at Frankenstein for abandoning him and hatred of mankind for not accepting him.
### Unchecked Ambition // Actions have consequences

* the danger of seeking too much knowledge and the risks of unchecked ambition. 
	* Victor Frankenstein's obsession with creating life leads to his downfall. His pursuit of scientific discovery, without thinking about the consequences, brings about suffering and death.
*  lack of responsibility can lead to failure, and that actions can have unintended consequences.
	* Victor's obsession with creating life and his pursuit of scientific discovery without considering the consequences leads to suffering and death. Both his loved ones and then finally himself.
* ambition to destroy the creature leads to Victor's death.

* Ambition caused Victor to create new life -- the creature -- which only caused him suffering. Ambition again calls Victor to seek revenge -- which he dies while continuing to pursue.

### Nature versus nurture

* Victor falls victim to nature and the creature to nurture.
* Shelley argues that the monster's rage is a result of his experiences with humans, such as being rejected by Victor Frankenstein and society.
### Role of Nature

* Nature can be a healing agent as well as destruction.

* Victor finds solace in solitude with nature, and appears to use it as a coping mechanism to escape from the horrors of his life. Especially the lakes and mountains.

* Victor is weakened by the Arctic weather while hunting for the Monster, and is almost killed on the ice.

### Revenge is a response to injustice

* Frankenstein resenting The Creature and hunting him down until he dies.
* The Creature resenting Frankenstein and ended up living solely to bring tragedy and ruin onto him and his family.
