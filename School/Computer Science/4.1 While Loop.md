*a `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.*

* Once the end of the code inside the loop is reached, the program loops back to check the condition again.
	* If the condition is `true`, the block of code will execute again and the process repeats.
	* If the condition is `false`, the loop ends.
* One cycle where the condition is checked and the code inside the loop is executed is called an **iteration.**

`while (condition) {`
	`code`
`}`

### Scope

*The accessibility of variables within a program.*

Creating a variable within a while-loop makes it so that the variable only exists in the while loop. More specifically, the variable only exists within the iteration of the while-loop, then it gets deleted from memory.

ex:
```
int x = 5;
if(x == 5){
boolean b = true;
}
System.out.println(b);
```

This causes an error because the scope of b is only inside of the if condition.
