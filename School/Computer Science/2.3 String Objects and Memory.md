##### How data is allocated in memory

Stack
- part of memory used to store variables and their values
- When a primitive data type is initialized, space is allocated on the stack to store the variable and its value. 

- Much faster to store and access information on the stack.

Heap
- When we don't know the size of the objects, we store them on the Heap. On the other hand, we know the size (in bits) of ints, doubles, etc. so that stuff can easily go on the stack.

- What happens is 
	- a reference variable is assigned to a reference (memory address). That reference "refers" to the object stored in the heap. It holds the memory address of the object.

- Strings are immutable meaning their values cannot be altered after creating them. Instead, the variable can be **reassigned** to reference a different String in memory.

- s1 here is reassigned a value. The reference of s1 does change, but the object itself (that is stored on the Heap) still remains and exists. It has not been touched in any way.

##### Creating a String using new

- The `==` operand compares **values** when used on primitive data types. 
- But, the ``==`` compares memory addresses when used on objects. 
	- so comparing a normal normal string with a "new" string with `==` equals false/ not equal. 

- However, equals() method can be used to compare strings by their actual values and individual characters.
- == operator, when used to compare strings, just compares the location/memory address.

##### Null Reference

1. Null is not the same as empty string or the value 0, it is a distinct value that represents the absence of a value.

##### Escape Sequences

- Escape sequences are used in Strings to print special symbols or commands.
- All escape sequences will start with a backslash 

`\n` = new line
`\"` = quotation marks
`\\` = backslash

`\t` = tab
