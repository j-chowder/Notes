##### Static Methods

`public int getSum(int a, int b)` is an instance method.

- It is what we have dealt with so far, and can only be used once an object of its class has been created.

`public static int getSum(int a, int b)` is a static method.

- can be called without creating an object from the class
- are called with the class name rather than by an object.
	- i.e. Calculator.getSum(1, 2) 
		- where `Calculator` is the class.

#### Random Numbers

- Math.random() is used for RNG.
	- without any tinkering, it returns a double value from `[0, 1)`
	- We want integers over doubles.

- To do that:

`int randomInt = (int)(Math.random() * upper bound) + increment;`

- where upperbound is the range of random numbers up to - but not including - itself.
- where increment is added to the lower and upper bounds range of random numbers.

`int randomInt = (int)(Math.random() * 10) + 1;`
- `[1, 10]`
