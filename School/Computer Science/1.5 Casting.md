Instead of needing a mixed expression where x and y are temporarily promoted to a double,
the same effect can be achieved by "casting x" to a double.

``double z = (double) 9/2;``

Casting temporarily changes a variable from one type to another.

##### Widening Conversion

a smaller type is converted to a larger type.

`double y = (double) 7/2; = 3.5`

despite it being temporary, note that you still can not store a larger type into a smaller data type. 

i.e. `int a = (double) 7/2; = compiler error`

---
##### Narrowing Conversion

- casting is required to convert a double to an int.
- When converting from a double to an int, the decimal part of the value is truncated (THERE IS NO ROUNDING).

- `int x = 3.5; // compiler error
- `int y = (int) 3.5; // 3`
- `int z = (int) 3.99; // 3`
