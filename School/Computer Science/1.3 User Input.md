User input is to assign a value to a variable based on the user's input.

Steps to get "user input"

1. Import the Scanner class
2. Create the Scanner object
3. Call a method to handle user input

---
1. Importing the Scanner Class

	- the Scanner class is premade code in the `java.util` package, we want to import that into our program. Make sure that the import statement goes above your class block.
	- `import java.util.Scanner;`

2. Creating the Scanner Object

	- Since a "class" is similar to a house, we need to choose/create an instance (or object) of that class to use the method. This must go before you get user input.
	- `Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);`

3. Calling a method to handle user input

	- To handle user input, call a method using `keyboard`

	- `int value = keyboard.nextInt();`
		- The `nextInt()` method pauses the program until the user types an integer into the console and presses enter. Then that integer will be stored to the `value` variable.
		

	- `String input = keyboard.nextLine();`
		- The `nextLine()` method pauses the program until the user types something into the console and presses enter. That will be stored to the `input` variable.

	- Note that if you try and do a `nextLine()` method after a `nextInt()` method, it will not pause the program and wait for user input. 
		- To fix this, just call `keyboard.nextLine()` after the `nextInt()`.
