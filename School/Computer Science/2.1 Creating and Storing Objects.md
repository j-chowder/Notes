Class
- a blueprint/template for creating objects. Classes contain data and methods.
	- Treat it as a "house" that contains the numerous methods.
	- We can't do anything with the class until we make an "object" out of it first.

Method
- block of code in a class that executes when it is called.

Access specifier can be public or private
- pubic allows the method to be accessed by other classes
- private restricts the method from being accessed by other classes.

Return type indicates which data type the method will return
- i.e. `int` requires the method to return an integer value
- `void` means does not return any value.
- `return` statement returns a value back to where the method was called, then immediately exits the method.
	- meaning no further code in the method is executed after the `return` statement. 

method name is used to call the method.

Parameters are placeholder variables used to receive values when the method is called.

Object

- An instance of a class
- provides access to the data and methods defined in a class 
- Interchangeable with "instance variable"

- `name of class` `variable` = new `name of class`();
	- how you create an object.
	- The `variable` is used to call methods from the class.
	- All objects MUST be created with the `new` keyword. 

Calling Methods

- `variable`.`method name`(`its parameters`);
