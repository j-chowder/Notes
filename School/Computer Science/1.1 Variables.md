| char          | Single Character                                                                 | 'A', '$'       |
| boolean       | True or False                                                                    | true, false    |
|               |                                                                                  |                |
| **Data Type** | **Range of Values**                                                              | **Value**      |
| byte          |                                                                                  | Integers       |
| short         |                                                                                  | Integers       |
| ==int==       |                                                                                  | Integers       |
| long          | * From byte -> long, the range of values increase.                               | Integers       |
| float         |                                                                                  | Decimals       |
| ==double==    |                                                                                  | Decimals       |
| char          | Any single character enclosed by apostrophes                                     | Other          |
| ==boolean==   |                                                                                  | Other          |
| ==String==    | Stores a String Literal (Sequence of characters <br>enclosed by quotation marks) | Other          |

The smaller the range of values that a data type can have makes it smaller. Smaller data types cannot store a greater data type.

Ex: a 'double' can store 'int' but an 'int' can not store 'double'

Declaring a Variable means creating a variable without giving it a value.

``` dataType variableName;```

	i.e. int age;

Variable naming rules:

1. Must follow a data type
2. Must start with a letter, $, or _
3. Cannot contain spaces
4. Cannot be reserved keywords in Java (ex: class, static, int, true)
5. Cannot have punctuation characters
6. case sensitive.

Assigning a Value to a Variable

- After creating a variable, you can store information into it.
	- Note that the information that you store must be compatible with the datatype that the variable is. A decimal can not go into a 'int' data type, for instance.

- To change the value of a variable, use the assignment operator (=)

```int age; // Declares an integer variable```
```age = 25; // Assigns a value to age```
```age = 10; // Reassigns a new value to age```

Initializing a Variable

- Initializing a variable is when you declare a variable and assign it a value all on one line.

```dataType variableName = value;```

Special Initialization

- When you have multiple variables of the same type, you can declare the type once and initialize all the variable in a single statement.

```int number1 = 5, number2 = 6;```

---

Strings store String Literals
- The String Literal must be enclosed in quotations marks.
	- If not, the value is treated as a variable.

String Concatenation

- Using the + operator to combine Strings.

```String cat1 = "Mittens";```
```String cat2 = "Coconut";```
```String phrase = cat1 + " and " + cat2;```
```System.out.println(phrase);```

```Output: Mittens and Coconut```
