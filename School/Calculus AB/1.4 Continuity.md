In order for a function to be continuous:
- f(c) exists
- lim (x -> c) exists
- lim (x - > c) = f(c).
	- Or: draw the line without having to take the pencil off the paper.
	- Otherwise, it is discontinuous.
---
When proving that f(x) is continuous at x = a for a piecewise:
- lim (x -> a)$^-$ = lim (x -> a)$^+$ 
- lim (x -> a) = f(a)
---

Discontinuities
- Removable (canceling out x from top and bottom).
	- Hole in the function
- Jump: Filled hole and open hole on different y-values
	- You basically need to "jump" to continue tracing the function.
- Nonremovable: vertical asymptotes
