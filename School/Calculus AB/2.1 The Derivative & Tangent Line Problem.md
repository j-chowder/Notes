- Average rate of change over (a, b) is f(b) - f(a)/ b - a
	- Rise over run

- If you have the graph of f’(x), and are asked for the slope of f(a), look at the graph and see b for (a, b).

	- Which makes sense: you are basically solving for f’(x) for a and getting the solution (which is the y-value)

- To determine whether a piecewise function is differentiable, differentiate both equations. If they do not equal to each other, the function is not differentiable.


- Limit Function
	- lim x->0- (f(c + h) - f(c)/h
	- If you see it in this form, can just turn it back into f(x) and then f'(x).
