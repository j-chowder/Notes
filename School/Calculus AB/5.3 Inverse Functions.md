#### What exactly are Inverse Functions & how to get them

- Inverse functions (f^-1(x)) are simply functions that serve to undo the original function so that it = x. 
- To check if two functions are inverses, set f(g(x)) or g(f(x)). This must equal x.
- The domain of f(x) is the range of f^-1(x)
- The range of f(x) is the domain of f^-1(x)
- It can only exist if
	- 1.) the original function is [[Monotonic]]. 
	- 2.) the original function is "One-to-One"
		- Note that if the function is One-to-One, it is automatically monotonic.

- To get the inverse of a function (provided that one exists)
	- 1.) turn it into a y = x + b.
	- 2.) switch the y and x.
	- 3.) solve for the new y.

### One-to-One
- Basically means that both the original and the inverse are functions.
	- Because passes both horizontal and vertical line tests.
	- Vertical is to see if OG is function
	- Horizontal is to see if inverse is function.

- To know, draw the original function and draw vertical lines and horizontal lines. These lines must never touch the graph more than once with the same line.

### Derivative of Inverse (at a point)

#### g'(x) = 1/f'(g(x))
*where g(x) = f^-1(x)*

1. First check if f(x) has an inverse.
	1. monotonic (w/ derivative)
	2. One-to-One (w/ graph)
2. With the provided a (the point), solve f(x) = a for x.
	1. Since the x of f(x) is the y of g(x)
	2. and the y of f(x) is the x of g(x)
		1. x = g(a), so f(x) = a 
3. Input the formula, make sure that you put in g(a) in 1/f'(x).
