- First: get the base
	- draw the curves, find intercepts, etc. 
	- then SUBTRACT: greater - lower.
	- Then just remember the formulas.

- Isosceles Right Triangle
	- Leg on base
		- s$^2$/2
	- Hypotenuse on base
		- s$^2$/4

- Cross-sections are founded by the area formula of the shape. The base of that is replaced by the "base"
	- because the cross-section shapes are sitting on top of the "base" - thus the base is used in the area formula for the shape.
- If area is given, then to turn it into volume, just integrate it. (Stacking Areas on top of each other with infinite number from a to b.)


- Note that if the question gives you the area formula of the cross section, just use the graph to find the intervals. You do not need to calculate/substitute in any base because we USE the base to get the area on actual cross-section shapes.
	- They are spoon-feeding you the area.
	- We do not need to use the base from (upper - lower) because that is essentially used as a replacement for the radius/side/length to actually calculate the area.
	- Then you use that area and integrate it, (the intervals is actually the height so that you can actually get a volume)
