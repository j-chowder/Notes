- You usually need to do ln integration when it is a (1/x) function, as doing integration power rule normally results in DNE.
	- Remember that the integral of **1/x = ln | x | + c**
- ln integration allows us to be able to integrate trigonometric functions that we were unable to before.
	- ==tanxdx = -ln |cosx| + c==
	- ==cotxdx = ln |sinx| + c==
	- ==secxdx = ln |secx + tanx| + c==
	- ==cscdx = -ln |cscx + cotx| + c==

- In order to be able to integrate **rational functions**, it has to be a **proper function** ([[Proper and Improper Fractions]])
- Go to [[Integration]] and [[U-Substitution]]
