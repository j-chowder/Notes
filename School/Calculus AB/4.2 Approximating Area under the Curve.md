You can approximate area under the curve, not exact like with [[Integration]], by doing Riemann Sums and/or Trapezoid approximation.

Riemann Sums
- Uses rectangles to draw out the area under the curve, and we basically just find a bunch of areas of the various rectangles and add them together.
- 4 rectangles (n = 4) used to approximate the area under curve. 
- Right Riemann: Uses, (when n = 4) x$_1$ - x$_4$ 
	- In a positive slope, Right Riemann sum is an "overestimation"
	- In a negative slope, Right Riemann sum is an "underestimation"
- Left Riemann: Uses, (when n = 4): x$_0$ - x$_3$ 
	- In a positive slope, Left Riemann sum is an "overestimation"
	- In a negative slope, Left Riemann sum is an "underestimation"
- Midpoint Riemann Sum: Uses (when n = 4), the averages. I.e. 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2
	- Is the "closer" approximation regardless of slope.

Trapezoid 
- Uses the height of the trapezoid as the base, and the triangular part to "trace" the curve.
- A = 1/2(Δx){f(x$_0$) + 2f(x$_1$) + 2f(x$_2$) +... + 2f(x$_n$) + f(x$_f$)}

#### How to set up Riemann + Trapezoid 

1. Set up the number line with the intervals. Split up the line to have n rectangles
2. Label x$_n$ (amount of n = what the last x$_n$ should be)
3. Calculate Δx (Don't need to if widths are different, in which case x$_n$$_+$$_1$ - x$_n$  becomes the Δx for that specific area)
	1. Δx = (b-a)/n
		1. b = upper bound
		2. a = lower bound
		3. n = # of rectangles/trapezoids
4. Multiply with x$_n$'s to obtain x$_i$'s 
5. A$_n$ = (Δx)(f(x$_i$))
	1. Note that if f(a) is given for your x$_i$'s then you can skip getting the x$_i$'s 
6. A(total) = Σ(A$_n$), or plugging into the Trapezoid formula

## Midpoint Riemann
- Same thing as left/right - but your x$_n$'s will be the normal x$_n$s divided by 2.
	- For instance, it would be x$_0$$_.$$_5$, x$_1$$_.$$_5$, etc.
		- Since these are your x$_n$'s, do the same thing as normal Riemann - multiply the 
		 x$_n$'s with the Δx to get your x$_i$'s.
	- Then get the individual areas with Δx f(x$_i$)
