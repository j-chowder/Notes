Proper and improper fractions are types of **rational functions.** 
- A rational function is one that can be written as a polynomial divided by a polynomial.

A proper fraction is a "type 1 functions," where "m," (the exponent of the numerator) is **lower** than "n," (the exponent of the denominator)
- m < n

An improper fraction are type 2 and type 3 functions
- type 2: where m = n
- type 3: where m > n

In a case where you need to integrate an improper fraction, you will need to perform "long division" - divide the numerator by the denominator.

Steps:
1. Try to match the exponents of the divisor to the dividend. In this case, x$^2$ and x$^2$, the coefficient would be 1, so put a 1 on top.
2. Subtract by multiplying the first number (1) by the divisor.
3. To know when you are finished, the exponent of the remainder has to be smaller than the exponent of the **divisor** 
4. The remainder just gets added separately, divided by the divisor.
