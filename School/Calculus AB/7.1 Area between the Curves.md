1. Identify the domain
	1. If not given, set the two equations to each other and solve for x (or y)
2. Then sketch the graph to see which curve is the greater/bigger one.
	1. Plot the intersections first, then sketch the individual graphs.
	2. This is to know which order to subtract with: upper - lower (or right - left)
	3. I recommend finding intercepts to get a better idea of the curves. (x = 0, y = 0)
3. Definite integral time! Solve!
