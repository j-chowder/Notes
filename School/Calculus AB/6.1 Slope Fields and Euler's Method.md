- Basically using the slopes (dx/dy) to draw the solution f(x).

- Tips:
	- Horizontal lines on x-axis need to be slightly above (so that they can see it)
	- If there is a asymptote, do not cross - draw an open circle to indicate that it is DNE
	- If only y in the equation, rows will have the same slope.
	- If only x in the equation, columns will have the same slope.
	- Identify what makes the dy/dx and therefore the graph equal to DNE and 0.
