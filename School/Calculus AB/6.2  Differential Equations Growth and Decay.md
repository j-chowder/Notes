- Basically the integration of [[2.5 Implicit Differentiation]]


Tips:
1. Can not add/subtract variable to separate - always divide/multiply over to the corresponding d(variable)
	1. I.e. can not split (y-1) by subtracting, just divide over.
	2. get y with dy and x with dx.
2. The absolute value must be kept if no point is provided - if point is provided, must drop off.
	1. If the absolute value ended up positive after substituing the y-value, then drop off abs. value and thats it.
	2. If ended up negative, then drop off abs. value | y + a | and replace it with -(y + a)
3. When exponentiating to remove the ln, must turn any coefficients in front of the ln into a power (logaramithic properties)
