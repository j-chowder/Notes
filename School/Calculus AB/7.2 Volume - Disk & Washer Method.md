- Notes
	- To show work, draw the curve(s) and the axis of rotation arrow.
	- You can only use the disk method if there is no gap/disattachment of the curve on the axis of rotation.
		- If there is gap/disattachment, you need to use washer method.

- Literally the same thing as Area between the curve but R(x) is squared and its integral is multiplied by pi. 
- Draw the curves, see where the area is, and then rotate it on an axis. If it is not fully connected to the axis of rotation, use washer method.
