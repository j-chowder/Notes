### Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
- Needs to be continuous on the interval (a, b)
- f(a) < f(c) < f(b)
- Thus guarantees that there will exist a number "c" in the interval (a, b) such that f(c) = k.

- This is the easiest one: if the interval is continuous and f(c) is between f(a) and f(b), then of course there will be a c that makes f(c) = k.
- Think: if f(a) is 1 and f(b) is 10, and the f(x) = x + 1, then there will be a "c" that makes f(c) equal to 4. 
	- c = 3.

### Squeeze Theorem
- g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x)
- lim ( x -> a) g(x) = C = lim (x -> a) h(x)
- Then lim (x -> a) f(x) = C and f(a) exists.

- Qualitatively: if f(x) is between g(x) and h(x), and g(x) and h(x) have the same limit, then f(x) will have the same limit.
- This makes sense too: if the bottom function has the same limit as the top function then the middle function should have the same limit as well.

### Mean Value Theorem (MVT)
- Continuous and differentiable on (a,b) (if differentiable then implies continuity)
- guarantees at least one "c" such that f'(c) is parallel to f(b) - f(a) / b - a 
	- Or: f'(c) = slope of line between f(b) and f(a)

### Extreme Value Theorem
- Continuous
- **Closed interval**
	- This is because there needs to be a definite ending point since the bounds are usually where the absolute extrema are located.
	- if it is {0,5) and f(5) is the largest, then there can't be an absolute maximum because the function can infinitely approach closer and closer to f(5) but never reaches it.
- Guarantees absolute max and min in the interval.
	- NO DUH!!!
