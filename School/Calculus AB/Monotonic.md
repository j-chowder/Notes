A monotonic function can either be monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.

- Monotonically increasing:
	- The function is always increasing or constant
- Monotonically decreasing:
	- the function is always decreasing or constant. 

---

- To check if a function is monotonic, take the derivative and test values.
- It must be consistently positive or consistently negative in order for a function to be monotonic.
---
### Uses
- Being monotonic is one of the two prerequisites for a function to have an **inverse function** ([[5.3 Inverse Functions]])
- Note that a function that is One-to-One means that it is monotonic, but a monotonic function is not necessarily a One-to-One.


### How to Show work

1. Get the derivative
2. Test values, then determine whether f'(x) is greater than or equal to 0, greater than, or less than or equal to 0, or less than.
3. Then state that it is "always increasing" or "always decreasing"
4. Then it is monotonic.
