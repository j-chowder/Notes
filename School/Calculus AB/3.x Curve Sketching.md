Notes:
- f(x) increase, f'(x) > 0
- f(x) decrease, f'(x) < 0
- f(x) = b (horizontal tangent/mins, maxes), f'(x) = 0
- f(x) is at POI, f'(x) = relative min/max.
	- This is because POI queues a rel extrema on f(x), so f'(x) needs to turn around and head towards the x-axis. Thus creating a rel extrema on f'(x).
- f(x) concave up, f'(x) increasing
- f(x) concave down, f'(x) decreasing

- To identify f(x), f'(x), and f"(x)
	- First try to just match their rel mins/maxes.
		- i.e. f(x) has 3 rel extrema
		- so f'(x) will cross the x-axis 3 times
		- If f'(x) has 2 rel extrema
		- then f"(x) will cross the x-axis 2 times
	- It is important to look at the # of POIs for f(x) and then match that with the same # of rel extrema for f'(x)
	- Or just draw as well.
