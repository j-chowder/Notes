- For limits approaching an asymptote, split the limit into "approaching from left" and "approaching from right".
	- I.e. if the asymptote was at x = 3 (and the limit is approaching 3), then:
	- approach from the left: plug in x = 2.9 and see if the equation ends up negative or positive
	- approach from the right: plug in x = 3.1 and see if the equation ends up negative or positive.
		- If the equation ends up negative, then the limit is - ∞.
		- If the equation ends up positive, then the limit is + ∞.
