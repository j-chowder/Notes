### d/dx (lnx) = 1/x.   d/dx (ln|x|) = 1/x

--- 
To understand: 
- Think of curve sketching to prove the identity
- To differentiate ln(x), the basic form will be $$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$
 i.e. a situation that this would be useful to know is **ln(lnx$^2$)**

- treat (lnx$^2$) as one whole variable -> 2lnx (ln property, power into coefficient), then differentiate with the overall outside ln. The top which is f'(x) would equal 2/x
$$\frac{2/x}{2lnx}$$
Which equals 1/xlnx

Even if there is no ln in the problem, in situations where the quotient rule would be a complete pain to solve for, forcing a ln on both sides of the equation then turning the quotient ln(a/b) into a ln(a) - ln(b) problem can make it much easier.
- You will just need to implicitly differentiate the y and substitute y = (x) from the original equation.

---
Properties that are important to make solving easier:
- ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b)
- ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)
- ln(x$^n$) = nln(x)

Remember that [[Product Rule]], [[Quotient Rule]], [[Chain Rule]], [[Trig Identities for Differentiation]], and [[2.5 Implicit Differentiation]] is all fair game.
