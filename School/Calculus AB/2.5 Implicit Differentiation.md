Basically just differentiate y as dy/dx.
- y$^2$ would have to use chain rule, as technically, the base is complicated.
	- 2y(dy/dx)
---
Use when you can not solve for y (when it is not a function, i.e. circle), or when it gets weird.

- When looking for horizontal/vertical tangent lines of implicit, derive it and set both numerator and denominator = 0. 
	- Numerator = 0 is horizontal, denominator = 0 is vertical.
- Then, find values for both that makes it = 0 but does not make the other one = 0. Denominator and numerator can not both = 0.
	- Also have to make sure that the # you test can be plugged into the original to find a proper coordinate. I.e. if y = 2, make sure that an x-value pertains to that.
