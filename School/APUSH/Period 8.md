		- Broke the laws of self-determination and broke the promise. 
	- Soviet has East Germany - Berlin is in East Germany, but Berlin was also split between powers.
	- Soviets wanted to keep Germany weak and for them to pay lots of reparations. U.S. wanted to help Germany become strong again - saw revitalized Germany (economy) as a key to stable central Europe.
		- "Iron Curtain"
