## 1607 - 1754
##### Founding of Jamestown --> French and Indian War
---
## Main concepts
- Motives/methods of that Europeans used to colonize Americas
	- British, French, Dutch, Spanish, etc. rushed to colonize Americas - but did it differently based off of their motives for colonization.

### French
- French were more interested in trade than conquest.
	- fish and fur
- Relatively few
- Intermarried with Native wives which kept kinship ties alive.
- Natives -> beaver skins. French -> iron cookware and manufactured cloth

### Dutch
- Fur trading center on Hudson river.
- Mostly economic 
- Mostly protestant but no interest in converting natives
- 1624 New Amsterdam - hub of trade.

## British
- new economic opportunities and land.
- seek religious freedom and improved living conditions

### Spain
- extract gold and silver from the Americas
- stimulate Spanish economy and make Spain a more powerful country
- Convert Native Americans to Christianity.

Chesapeake Region
- Jamestown
	- first permanent colonial settlement. 
	- profit-seeking indentured servants.
	- disease and famine killed 7/8.
	- Discovered tobacco cash crop -> huge influx of investment 
New England
- 1620 settled by pilgrims
	- migrated in family units in order to establish a society (NOT PROFIT-SEEKING)
- Christian religion goal-orientated

West Indies
- Warm climate allowed year-round growing seasons.
	- Tobacco and Sugarcane.
		- Sugarcane very labor-intensive. Demand for sugarcane = demand for slave labor.
Middle Colonies
- many rivers -> export economy (cereal crops)
- "Breadbasket"
- Pennsylvania
	- religious freedom for all
	- Land was negotiated with the Indians (not taken)
	
British colonists wanted more land to grow more tobacco -> steal lands from Natives --> Natives get mad and start raiding colonial farms to retaliate --> ==Bacon's Rebellion== 

- Bacon's Rebellion
	- Nathaniel Bacon led angry poor farmers (indentured servants) in an attack against Indians and then turned their militia towards the plantations owned by elites.
	- Effect:
		- Planter elites fear indentured servants --> want to stop using indentured servants for labor --> turn to African Slavery.

### Self-governing structures of Colonies

Mayflower Compact
- Pilgrims (before disembarking Mayflower)
- Organized government on the model of a self-governing church congregation.

House of Burgesses
- Virginia
- Representative assembly that could levy taxes and pass laws.
Etc.
- Just know that where there was self-government, that it was **dominated by the elite.**
New York Assemblies
- Dominated by wealthy landlords
Southern Assemblies
- Dominated by elite planters

### Mercantilism
Triangular Trade
 ![[Pasted image 20240409180150.png]]

- Belief that power of a nation is determined by the amount of gold/silver/export that the nation does.
- Relied heavily on establishing colonies (where raw materials are)
- Impacted the Colonies
	- wealth for the elites/merchants/plantation owners
	- America's seaports into trading centers.

---
### Slavery
- 1700-1808 3 million Africans 
- Mostly in the British West Indies
	- every British colony participated in the slave trade
		- because of the wealth gained due to free labor in the export economies dedicated to cash crops.
	- New England colonies had relatively few slaves
	- Chesapeake and Southern had lots of slaves

Slave Codes
- Slavery was turned into hereditary status
- Restricted their rights and turned them into property
- To keep them more controlled and to turn them into a growing labor force

Resistance to Slavery
- Covert
	- Maintain cultural customs and belief systems
	- Broke tools, ruined seeds, faked illness.
- Overt
	- ==Stono Rebellion== (1739)
		- Group of slaves stole weapons from a store and killed its owners.
		- Burned plantations and killed white folks
		- Effect: a new harsher slave code

---
Native Resistance
- King Phillip's War (1675)
	- No like British encroachment on Native lands
	- large alliance of many different Native tribes 
	- Attack white settlements throughout New England
		- burned fields
		- killed men
		- captured women and children

---
Enlightenment
- Movement in Europe.
- Emphasized rational thinking over tradition and religion.
- Reached colonies via print - spread ideas of John Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau
	- ==Introduced to the colonies the ideas of **natural rights**==
	- Best form of gov was checks and balances
	- Social Contract (The people give power to the government; government has to protect the natural rights of the people; if government no do, people can overthrow)

Great Awakening
- Causes:
	- People started caring less about religion (Enlightenment) -> Church feared it.
	- reaction against materialism and rationalism that dominated the culture.

- Massive religious revival -> intense Christian enthusiasm
- Johnathan Edwards
	- New England minister
- George Whitefield
	- Preaching everywhere

- Effects:
	- large-scale return to Christianity
	- Mutual experience that bonded colonists (**initiatives of American identity**)
	- **Individualism, equality, and the right to challenge authority.**
