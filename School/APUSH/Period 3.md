## 1754 - 1800
###### French and Indian War --> Jefferson's Election
---
## Main Concepts:
- America transforming into a collection of British colonies into a distinct independent nation + developing distinct American identity.
- The causes + effects of the Revolutionary War

## 1754 - 1763
- French and Indian War 
	- Caused by English encroachment onto French lands
	- Most natives sided with the French
	- Great Britain wins the war --> France removed from NA.
	- Conflicts emerge between American colonists and Natives as colonists seek to expand
		- Pontiac's Rebellion
			- Caused due to British encroachment into Western Ohio River Valley
			- Resulted in Proclamation Line of 1763 (Can not go West of Appalachians)
				- Colonists very mad bc they just fought for this land and they cant get it 
	- Albany Plan of Union
		- Place the colonies under a more centralized government
			- Tried to coordinate colonial defense for the French and Indian War.
		- Laid the mold for the future congress

**French and Indian War drastically changed the relationship between the British and the Colonists. 
## 1763 - 1776 (Taxation without Representation)
- Britain is in debt from the war, ends salutary neglect, takes a more active role in colonial affairs.

- Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Townshend Acts, Intolerable Acts, Tea Act
	- Way for the British to raise revenue
- Quartering Act
	- Imperial troops remain in the colonies to enforce the new rules

- Colonists resist the new control
	- Committees of Correspondence

	- Daughters/Sons of Liberty
	- Stamp Act Congress
		- Repeal Stamp Act

	- First Continental Congress
		- Reaction to Intolerable Acts
		- Agreed that the colonies needed to resist further violations of liberties from Parliament
			- Still no desire for independence - just wanted to preserve liberties. 
		- EXAMPLES OF **COLONAL UNITY** AGAINST THE BRITISH.

- Elitists and everyday colonists were united against the British
- Up until 1776, most colonists did NOT want independence - only want salutary neglect.

- British repealed Stamp Act but also passed the Declaratory Act
	- Britain has the right to pass any law on the colonies.

- Boston Massacre
	- Colonists viewed as proof of increasing British tyranny
## 1776 - 1783

- **Common Sense**
	- Thomas Paine
	- Urged America to break away
	- Helped influence Declaration of Independence
- Declaration of Independence
	- Grievances against King George 3rd, justification for breaking away
	- Inspired by Common Sense and other Enlightenment ideas - natural rights, consent of the governed, etc.
- Why did the colonists win the war?
	- Familiarity with the land
	- Military leadership (George Washington)
	- Strong beliefs/motivation - natural rights and independence
	- Foreign Aid
		- Before Saratoga: provided supplies, funding, ammunition, etc.
		- After Saratoga: joined with actual forces

## 1783 - 1800

- Fear of centralized power --> create **Articles of Confederation**
	- Weak central government, could not tax, no executive branch, most power left to states.
		- Was basically just a coalition of 13 independent states 
- Trade issues emerged between states

- Northwest Ordinance of 1787
	- Provided a process for admitting new states
	- Procedures for statehood
	- Banned slavery in NW territory.

- Tensions emerged in west v. east.
	- Shay's Rebellion - MA
		- farmers that were debtors.
		- Importance: Displayed the weakness of the AoC (no president + no national army)

- Impact of the Declaration of Independence and American Revolution?
	- Revolutions in France, Haiti, and Latin America
	- Although some called for greater equality, framers of the Constitution postponed the issue of slavery. 
		- Bc no Southern states would agree to the Constitution if it banned slavery

- Constitution
	- Great Compromise, 3/5 compromise, Slave Trade compromise.
	- Ratified after Federalists promised Anti-Federalists a Bill of Rights would be added.

	- Initially:
		- Virginia Plan
			- Represented by population (Favored the big states)
		- New Jersey Plan
			- Equal representation of population (Favored small states)
	- Result: The Great Compromise
		- bicameral Congress:
			- House of Representatives - states represented by population
			- Senate - equal votes (2 per)

	- 3/5 Compromise
		- North don't want slaves to count towards population
		- Southerners want slaves to count as population (boost power in House)

- Hamilton's Financial Plan
	- pay foreign war debts
	- assume state debts
	- create national bank

	- Critics (Anti-federalists) argued that Constitution did not explicitly allow a bank.

- Elastic Clause
	- Allow Congress to exercise implied powers to carry out necessary and proper things, EVEN IF NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN CONSTITUTION.

- Challenges to new Government
	- Navigation on the Mississippi River (Spain)
		- Pinckney's Treaty

	- Relations with Natives, land issues as Natives ceded more and more land.

- Washington's Farewell Address:
	- Warned of: entangled foreign alliances and political parties.
	- Political parties emerged regardless: Federalists (Hamilton) and Republicans (Jefferson and Madison)
- Debates over power of government
	- State vs. National
		- Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions (response to Aliens and Seditions Act)
			- Can states nullify a federal law?
	- Federalists vs. Antifederalists
		- Whiskey Rebellion
			- uprising that afforded the new U.S. government its first opportunity to establish federal authority using militia. 

- Democratic Republicans
	- Thought debt plan, national bank, response to Whiskey Rebellion, were evidence of federal overreach.
	- HATE ALIEN AND SEDITIONS ACT --> VA and Kentucky Resolutions

Republican Motherhood
- Women gained few, if any rights, after Revolutionary War
- Women were expected to instill Republican virtues (liberty, natural rights, etc.) in children, and be active in their families.
- Helped improve education for women.
	- As they were supposed to be educating their children.

Will last until around Age of Jackson (1824)
