## 1865-1898
###### End of Reconstruction -> Start of Imperialism
## Industrialization of America: Causes and Effects

Prior to industrialization, Americans made things either to use themselves or to be sold locally (on a small scale)

However, during this period, Americans began mass-producing goods to be sold nationally and all over the world (on a large scale)
###### Technology

- Railroad - a quick and easy means of transporting goods created the occasion for a truly national market for sales.
	- If goods are easy to transport over large distances, effect of opening up mass production and mass consumption
	- After Civil War, the miles of railroads built increased 5x
	- Promoted by the government to promote and spur the national economy
		- Land was promoted for railroads to be built on
	- Cornelius Vanderbilt
	
-  Railroads was able to be built due to **steel-production**
	- Henry Bessemer - patented a process for making steel of making much stronger quality
	- Bessemer Process - blast air through molten iron to cleanse impurities -> higher quality of steel
		- New method allowed for manufacturers to produce greater quantity and quality of steel.
	- Carnegie
		- J.P. Morgan, purchased Carnegie's steel business to form U.S. Steel.
	- Steel allowed for mass industrialization and urbanization; railroads, cars, skyscrapers,
- Greater access to resources
	- Coal, iron, oil
- Communication
	- Telegraph - Morse.
		- Communication could travel long distances efficiently, did connect national, but most importantly, with the **trans-Atlantic cable.** telegraphs connected America to Europe.
	- Telephone
		- Better telegraph
		- Alexander Graham Bell

### Gilded Age

- Industrialization (move toward mass production and mass consumption of goods) caused the **Gilded Age** (late 1800s)
- While industrialization brought numerous opportunities to workers and dramatically expanded the work force, low wages and dangerous working conditions continued to be a problem

- ##### Pros of Gilded Age
	- Carnegie was corrupt and monopolized but did have the "Gospel of Wealth"
		- Those with extraordinary wealth had a duty from God to invest their wealth back into society via philanthropy.
	- Mass production of goods caused the prices of common goods to decrease
		- This ultimately raised the "real wages" of most laborers to raise their standards of living
	- New economic opportunities for immigrants and workers
		- new career opportunities for women and minorities
	- 

- ##### Cons of Gilded Age
	- monopolies/trusts on oil, steel, and railroad industries

	- Oil 
		- John D. Rockefeller, owner of Standard Oil.
			- Company grew, and did "shrewd moves" to his competitors to sell their companies to him and eliminating competition. (Horizontal Integration)
		- Standard Oil was 90% of the oil industry
	- Steel 
		- Andrew Carnegie
			- Vertical Integration, buying the resources and distribution companies to dominate the industry
	- Large consolidation of wealth (minority had a majority of the wealth)
		- the rich actively flaunted and wastefully used their wealth (Conspicuous Consumption)
		- Then the poor living in poverty 
	- Bad safety standards & wages
		- desperate immigrants
		- This formed the labor unions.
			- One worker's voice is irrelevant, but when they joined together into a large union, factory workers had to listen.
	- Tenement housing was common 
		- pack as many people into one building
		- very small, bad living conditions, no outside windows, sharing toilets
		- documented by Jacob Riis "How the Other Half Lives"
	- Child labor becomes a problem


	- ##### Industrial leader, "Robber Barons," got away with consolidation of wealth because of:

		1.  laissez faire policies: politicians did not regulate or intervene with private companies
			- Rockefeller corruption, bribing, etc.
		2.  relied heavily on underpaid laborers
			- immigrants, children, women desperate for work
			- no regulations on price
				- there was so much demand for jobs and so little supply that people were willing to take a job and ultimately allow employers to set dangerously low wages, bad working conditions, no benefits, etc.
			- unskilled labor allowed for women and children to work (assembly lines) 
				- were paid less than men
		3. Social Darwinism
			- Applying Darwin's concepts of evolution and "survival of the fittest" to economics/society.
				- Strong companies eat weak companies.
				- World's wealth should be concentrated into the hands of the "fittest"

	- #### Addressing the Challenges of the Gilded Age
		-  Settlement House movement that sought to relieve urban poverty and provide assistance to immigrants
			- Jane Addams Hull House in Chicago
		- Social Gospel movement
			- Christians had responsibility to deal with urban poverty
		- Socialist Party and other organizations challenged capitalism
			- Eugene Debs 
		- Eventually lead to Progressive Movement in 1890s, 1900s.
		- National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)
			- Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt
			- sought to secure the right to vote for women (suffrage)
		- African Leaders -> advancing the cause of civil rights
			- Booker T. Washington
			- W.E.B. Du Bois

- #### Labor Movement
	- #### Unions
		- Formed because of poor safety regulations and bad wages during the Gilded Age
		- One worker's voice is irrelevant but if many people stood up in a group to resist, they become a force to be reckoned with.
		- Received hostility from corporations, and no protection by government (because government sided with companies bc of laissez faire until Roosevelt)
			- Yellow-Dog Contracts (had to sign contract of not forming unions)

	- National Labor Union
		- first attempt to organize all workers nationwide.
		- better working conditions, higher wages, 8-hour workday, equal rights for men and African Americans.

	- Knights of Labor (1869)
		- Terence Powderly, all workers (skilled & unskilled), women and African Americans
		- Decline following Haymarket Riot in 1886
	- American Federation of Labor
		- Samuel Gompers (skilled workers) 
		- Focus on "bread and butter" issues: wages, working conditions, 8-hour weekdays)
		- largest union by 1900
			- Congress of Industrial Organization --> Splits from AFL to include unskilled workers. (Great Depression --> WWII)

- #### Important Strikes
	 -  Great Railroad Strike of 1877
		- railroad companies cut wages to save money during a recession
		- unionized railroad workers went on strike to protest.
		- shut down more than 50% of the nations railroads.
		- President Hayes sent federal troops to clap
		- 100+ people dead
		- railroad employers saw the power/influence of unions, some decided to negotiate wages/contracts with strikers.
	
	- Homestead Strike (1892)
		- Carnegie's steel plant 
		- Strikers defeat Pinkertons, but national guard gets called and ends the strike
	- Pullman Strike (1894)
		- President Cleveland uses army and court injunction to defeat strike
		- Eugene Debbs goes to jail
	- Haymarket Square Riot (1886)
		- rally for 8-hour workday -> police intervened -> someone threw bomb and police fired into crowd. several dozens killed.
		- Alleged Knights of Labor to the bombing -> weakened Knights' reputation and influence
		- 

- ### Movement of People
	- Internal movement/migration
		- Settlers seeking opportunities on frontier head west
			- Homestead Act
			- Transcontinental railroad
		- Mass movement of people to urban areas (urbanization)
		- African Americans moving out of the south into northern cities (Great Migration)
			- leaving Jim Crow laws and segregation
	- External
		- large scale immigration from China to the west 
			- Hope Island, San Francisco
			- until Chinese Exclusion Act 1883
		- New immigrants (post 1880)

			- settled in urban areas for job opportunities
			- many were poor and illiterate peasants that left autocratic countries
			- largely Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, or Jewish.
			- settle into poor ethnic neighborhoods of New York, Chicago, etc.
	- #### Challenges of urbanization/immigration
		- cities were divided among classes, races, ethnicities, and cultures
			- Little Italy, China Town
		- immigrants try to assimilate and maintain their own unique cultural identities 
			- Melting pot idea vs. Salad bowl


	- #### Effects/Response of immigration
		- Rise in Nativism
			- immigrants are undesirable, will undermine and ruin the American way. 
			- Will corrupt America, i.e. nativists scared of them weakening the culture of Anglo majority.
			- steals jobs, etc. resented that employers used immigrants to depress wages and break strikes.
			- convenient scapegoats for economic problems.
		- Ellis Island
			- New York harbor as immigration center

			- American Protective Association
				- anti-Catholic group (from Protestants)
			- Literacy tests
				- proposed to keep southern and eastern European immigrants out
			- Contract Labor Law of 1885
				- restricted temporary workers

	- More positive responses to immigration
		- political machines (organized groups of politicians) welcomed newly arrived immigrants to gain loyalty in elections.
			- i.e. Tammany Hall
			- welfare, food, jobs, etc.
			- also corruption though from "Boss" Tweed of Tammany Hall. (stealing money from gov.)
		- Settlement Houses
			- Jane Addams
			- taught English to immigrants, provided education, gave food, gave jobs etc.

### Populism
(often gets tested)

Basic Summary
- mostly farmers in the Mid-West, wanted to get their voices heard in gov. specifically involving price inflations/interest rates, sharecropping $ issues.

---
- Populists were faming-based political movement.
	- aimed at improving conditions for the country's farmers and agrarian workers.
		- (Can be used as contextualization for any farming-based prompt, such as United Farm Workers in the 1960s or farmers in Jazz Age/Great Depression)
	- Landless tenant farmers rose; debts of farmers skyrocketed due to trash interest rates from banks.


- People's Party was a political party founded by the leaders of the Populist movement.
- Allied with the labor movement and folded into the Democratic Party in 1900s.
	- Since the Democratic Party championed many of the Populists' goals.
		- William Jennings Bryan.

- William Jennings Bryan:
	- Cross of Gold Speech
		- Condemned Gold Standard
			- Stated that it sacrifices laborers and the working class for the interests of the rich and big business.
		- Supported free silver
			- Farmers believed that an expanded currency would increase the price of crops.
			- Debtors hoped it would enable them to pay debts more easily.

			- Adding to the money supply would have ended the deflation and created the possibility of inflation. (Meaning debt is worth less)

- Omaha Platform:
	- graduated income tax, secret ballot, direct election of United States senators, the eight-hour day, and other reform measures.
	- protect farmers by fighting against America's growing use of gold as the exclusive standard for national currency
