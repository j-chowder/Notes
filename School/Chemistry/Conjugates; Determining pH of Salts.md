| Type of Ion | Examples | Comment | pH of solution |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Anion is the conjugate of a weak acid | C2H3O2-<br><br>CN-, F- | Anion is basic | Makes it more basic |
| Anion is the conjugate of a strong acid | Cl-, NO3-, I- | Anion is neutral | Neutral |
| Cation is the conjugate of a weak base | NH4+ | Cation is acidic | Makes the solution more acidic |
| Cation is from a strong base | K+, Na+ | Cation is neutral | Neutral |

- Explanation (Think of the Bronsted-Lowry definitions of Bases/Acids):
	- Weak acid -> CB
		- Because a weak acid barely dissociates, we can then reverse the equation and realize that, in a way, the CB is actually accepting a lot of protons to form the acid. 
		- Since the reaction lies heavily on the left, that means that there is little CB; in other words the CB is a strong base that accepts H$^+$ and forms the original acid.
		- Since the CB is a **stronger base than water**, it will make the pH of a solution more basic - however note that the K$_b$ is still very small - making it a weak base.
		- A -> H$^+$ + CB$^-$ 
		- H$^+$ + CB$^-$ -> A
	- Strong acid -> CB
		- Because a strong acid completely dissociates, the CB is actually accepting very little protons to reform the acid.
		- Since the reaction lies heavily on the right, that means that there is A LOT of CB; in other words the CB is a very weak base that does not accept H$^+$ to reform the original acid.
		- Since the CB is a **weaker base than water**, it is considered negligible and considered a neutral substance.
	- Weak base -> CA
		- Because a weak base barely accepts protons to form OH$^-$, the CA is technically doing a good job at giving away protons (barely any of it forms bc it keeps donating)
		- Since the reaction lies heavily on the left, that means there is little CA; in other words the CA is a strong acid that constantly donates H$^+$ to form the base.
	- Strong base -> CA
		- Because a strong base completely dissociates, the CA is actually donating very little protons (to reform the base)
		- Since the reaction lies heavily on the right, that means that there is A LOT of CA; in other words the CB is a very weak acid that is not giving away any protons. (IT IS KEEPING ITS H+)

- Salts are things made up of anions and cations - so anions as the conjugate acid, cations as the conjugate base.
- If the salts are put in water, it can create acidic, basic, or neutral solutions.
	- For conjugate acids (from base), look to see if contain group 1 or 2 elements, 
		- if yes, then strong base, so neutral
		- if no, then weak base, so acidic.
	-  Or... if the cation is a monoatomic element located on the Periodic Table, it is neutral.

	- For CBs/anions, basically just memorization.
		- If it came from a strong acid, it will be neutral
		- If it came from a weak acid, it will be basic.

If it is a salt that has both an acidic cation and a basic anion:
- compare K values of the conjugates.
	- We get these K values from their respective conjugate acid-base pairs.
		- K$_w$ = K$_a$K$_b$

## Equilibrium problems w/ Salts (pH)
1. Identify whether or not the salt is soluble ([[Solubility rules]])
2. identify the anions and cations; see which ones will provide the H$^+$/OH$^-$ (i.e. identify which ones are neutral/basic/acidic)
	1. neutral ones are disregarded
3. Calculate the specific K value using Kw = KaKb (from the conjugate acid-base pair)
The rest is same as normal:
1. Plug in ICE table, do equilibrium expression. 
2. Solve for x, use that to determine pH.
