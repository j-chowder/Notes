Basically: 
Changes that ruin the reactionâ€™s equilibrium will need to have the reaction "shift" to counteract said change.

##### Changes that a system can undergo (and how the system reacts to said change)

- Volume/pressure of the system.
	- When volume increases (expands), there is less pressure.
	- When volume decreases (compresses), there is more pressure.
		- Think of crushing something with pressure, gets smaller.
	
	- Only gases affect the pressure. So, compare the amount of moles of gases in the reactants and the products.
	- A pressure decrease shifts an equilibrium to the side of the reaction with the greater number of moles of gas.

		- Think: change made pressure lower than equilibrium, we need to increase the pressure to climb back up to equilibrium. So, reaction will **shift to the side with the greater number of molecules of gas.**  Shifts to the side with more moles because of molar ratios. If you need 2 reactants to make 3 products then it is a **net increase of moles.** 
		- More moles = more pressure (from pv=nrt)


	- A pressure increase shifts a reaction to the side with the lower number of moles of gas.
		- Think: change made pressure higher than equilibrium. We need to **decrease** the pressure to drop back down to equilibrium. So, reaction will **shift to the side with the lesser number of molecules of gas**
		- Side with less moles because of molar ratios. If you need 3 products to make 2 reactants then it will shift left because it is a **net decrease of moles.** 
		- Less moles = less pressure (from pv=nrt)

- **Temperature** changes on the system
	- This is the only factor that can change K
	- Energy is either reactant or product, depending on either the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.
		- i.e. removing energy from an endothermic reaction basically removes reactants so will need to shift left to produce more.
		- How it changes K: If shift left, more reactants, less product, and so smaller ratio

---
- concentration/pressure of a specific substance
	- Adding/removing substances, will shift to balance out the amount of reactant and amount of product.
		- i.e. adding reactants will cause it to shift left to create more products and remove reactants.

#### [[Reaction Quotient, Q]] and Le Chatelier's Principle

- Imposing a change to a system causes Q to not equal K. (The system is no longer at equilibrium.)
- Le Chatelier states that if change, needs to shift to counteract.
- So, the system shifts to bring Q = K. (to reestablish equilibrium). 

- Note:
	- Some changes, like concentration and partial pressure, only cause a change in Q.
	- But, temperature causes a change in **both Q and K.** 
		- Once it reestablishes equilbrium, Q and K will equal each other, but their values will be a **different number than what it was** before the temperature change.
