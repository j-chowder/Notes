- Strong acid reacts with strong base to form: **salt (ionic compound) and water.** 
- Acids contain H+ ions
- Strong bases contain OH- ions

- To form the product:
	- Switch the ions, form salt and water.
- Use solubility rules to determine if salt is soluble or insoluble.

---
- Conjugate acid is the product that forms when base gains H$^+$ 
- Conjugate base is the product that forms when acid gains H$^+$ 
	- Note that conjugates always have to be in the product.
