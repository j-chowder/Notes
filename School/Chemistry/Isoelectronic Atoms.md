- Substances with the same number of electrons.

- For isoelectronic ions, the only thing that determines atomic size/radius is the amount of protons in the nucleus.
	- Greater # of protons, smaller the atom.
		- Zeff increases due to protons -> outermost electrons are more attracted to the nucleus -> smaller atomic size.
- Since they have the same amount of electrons, there is no difference in repulsion.
- Thus only # of protons determine Zeff which determines size.
