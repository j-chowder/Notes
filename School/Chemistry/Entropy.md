- #### Measure of randomness or disorder
- ----
### (Absolute) Entropy (S)
- in J/K
- measure of disorder for a substance
- One factor in determining [[Spontaneity]] of a reaction
- Nature proceeds towards the states that have the highest entropies.
- Greater the disorder, greater the entropy.

#### To determine/compare entropy without actual numbers:
Go down the list: 
1. Gas >>  Liquid > Solid
	1. Greater the movement, greater the entropy. Gases move the most. Solids just vibrate.
2. Higher temperature
	1. More KE  -> more movement -> more disorder -> greater entropy
3. More complex the molecule
	1. more variations in rotations/vibrations = more entropy
	2. "Complexity" is just the # of atoms in the molecule (more bonds)

## Change in Entropy $\triangle$S$\degree$ 
- Shows whether a system is becoming more ordered or disordered. 
- $\triangle$S$\degree$ = S$_f$ - S$_i$ 

-  If in a reaction and asked for "increase or decrease in disorder"
	- more gas moles = more entropy.

- $\triangle$S$\degree$ > 0 when moles of gas in reactants < products
	- **Goes from less moles of gas** (so less movement and thus less disorder) -> **more moles of gas** (more movement and thus more disorder)
- $\triangle$S$\degree$ < 0 when moles of gas in reactants > products.
	- more movement -> less movement.
- $\triangle$S$\degree$ â‰ˆ 0 when moles of gas in reactants = products
	
- So, if the reactants had 3 moles of gases and products had 4 moles of gas, the $\triangle$S$\degree$ > 0

	- Anything that becomes more disordered, $\triangle$S$\degree$ > 0
	- Anything that becomes more ordered, $\triangle$S$\degree$ < 0
		- i.e. ice melting into water, $\triangle$S$\degree$  > 0.
			- Goes from solid -> liquid. More movement/mobility so greater entropy.

- To find a numerical $\triangle$S$\degree$,
- $\triangle$S$\degree$rxn = (sum of all products' entropies) - (sum of all reactants' entropies)
	- The entropies of the molecules/compounds are given.
