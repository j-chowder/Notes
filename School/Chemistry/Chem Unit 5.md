## [[Collision Model]]
- Molecules must collide in order to react:
	- At collision, has to meet:
		- E$_a$ 
		- Correct Molecular Orientation

## [[Factors Affecting Rate]]
- Temperature
	- Move faster + more energy
- Surface Area
	- particles will collide more often
- Concentration (usually)
	- more particles that will collide more often. More reactants in general so more chances that the collision will meet the requirements for a reaction to occur.
- Catalysts
	- lowers activation energy. 

## [[Reaction Rate]]
- (Change in A)/(Change in Time) = Rate of A.
	- Rates must always be positive.
- Rates are proportional stoichiometrically
- Slope determines rate (at a point)

## [[Differential Rate Law]]
- concentration of reactants and rate of reaction.

## [[Integrated Rate Laws]]

- concentration of reactants versus time

| Zero                | First                   | Second                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Rate = k            | Rate = k{A}             | Rate = k{A}$^2$        |
| {A} = -kt + {A}$_0$ | ln{A} = -kt + ln{A}$_0$ | 1/{A} = kt + 1/{A}$_0$ |
| {A} versus t        | ln{A} versus t          | 1/{A} versus t         |
| m = -k              | m = -k                  | m = k                  |
|                     | t$_1$$_/$$_2$ = 0.693/k |                        |

- Half-life
	- Time it takes for half of the initial concentration to react

## [[Reaction Mechanism]]

- Steps by which a reaction happens
- To be valid:
	- slowest step's rate law = overall rate law
	- has to add up to overall reaction
- Rate law is determined by the concentrations and their coefficients in the mini-step.
	- If there is a fast equilibrium step right above it - might need to substitute.

- Intermediate = product -> reactant.
- Catalyst = reactant -> product

## [[Catalysts]]
- Lower activation energies by:
	- Stabilizing the transition states of a mechanism
	- Changing the mechanism so it has a lower activation energy or different intermediates

- Types:
	- Homogenous
		- same phase as reacting molecules
	- Heterogeneous
		- different phase as reacting molecules
	- Enzyme
	- Acid-base
	- Surface

- Shortens the hill on a potential energy diagram
- Shifts to the left in a Boltzmann Distribution
