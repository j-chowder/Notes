## Basics of Equilibrium
- It is when the forward and reverse reactions of [[reversible reactions]] settle down and occur at the same rate. 
	- Concentrations of the product and reactant **remains unchanged.**
		- Can be different concentration, just needs the same rate.
- Is dynamic, not static.
	- Basically: things are moving and reactions are happening - just that the forward and reverse reactions are occurring at the same rate so there is no **net change**
- ![[Pasted image 20240114121752.png]]
	- Make sure to approximate the amounts with the molar ratios
	- All lines have to reach equilibrium at the same time
- ![[Pasted image 20240114121847.png]]
	- Must converge into the same line
	- the forward reaction decreases (as time progresses, less reactants so less speed)
	- the reverse reaction increases (as time progresses, more products so more speed)
## Equilibrium Constant, K
- The [[Equilibrium Constant, K]] is the ratio of the amount of products to the amount of reactants at equilibrium. 
- It can be tinkered with something similar [[Hess's Law]] 
- Only changes with temperature change
- Does not include solids and liquids. 

#### Le Châtelier’s Principle
- [[ Le Châtelier’s Principle]] states that a system at equilibrium, when stressed, will shift to offset the stress
	- If we remove product, equilibrium goes right, making product.
	- If we remove reactant, equilibrium goes left, making reactant
		- Basically: needs to balance out to be equal if you change stuff - adding product means that the equilibrium "goes left" (to reactant) to emphasize creating more reactants (as well as consuming products)
- Think of  “shifting left and right” as “creating reactant and product”
	- Shifting left means that it needs to emphasize the creation of reactants.
- A reaction not at equilibrium, depending on its [[Reaction Quotient, Q]] , will need to balance out its products and reactants so that it reaches the amounts in [[Equilibrium Constant, K]], (K).
	- I.e. if Q is bigger than K, that means that **Q has more products** than what is needed to reach equlibrium. Inversely, it means that **Q has too little reactants** than what is needed. So, by "shifting left," the **reaction favors the creation of the reactants** (left), using the products (right), as it is a [[reversible reactions]] 

- Volume/Pressure
	- Decreasing pressure, reaction shifts to the side that has more moles (needs more pressure)
		- To explain: side with more moles because of molar ratios. If you need 2 reactants to make 3 products then it is a **net increase of moles.** 
		- More moles = more pressure (from pv=nrt)
	- Increasing pressure, reaction shifts to the side that has less moles (needs less pressure)
		- Side with less moles because of molar ratios. If you need 3 products to make 2 reactants then it will shift left because it is a **net decrease of moles.** 
		- Less moles = less pressure (from pv=nrt)
- Temperature
	- Only one that can change K
		- it changes K because temperature affects reaction rates, not just concentration.
	- Energy is either reactant or product, depending on either exothermic or endothermic.
		- Just treat energy/heat as a reactant/product.
- concentration/ pressure of a specific substance
	- Adding/removing substances, will shift to balance out the amount of reactant and amount of product.

## Reaction Quotient, Q
- Similar to K, but for [[Reaction Quotient, Q]], we do not know if the concentrations are at equilibrium or not.
- Uses the given concentrations provided (that is not necessarily at the equilibrium molarity)
- Can be used to compare with K and determine characteristics of the reaction at that given time:
	- Q > K, shifts left
	- Q = K, at equilibrium
	- Q < K, shifts right

## Solving Equilibrium Problems
- It's just stoichiometry with algebra.
- You have starting amount, an amount that reacts, and then the final amount at the end (when system reaches equilibrium) 
- Either use concentration for normal problems or atm when doing pressure problems. (Atm is fine because everything is a ratio and they should all be in the same conditions for PV = NRT to be disregarded)
- Use [[ICE Tables]] to organize and make this easy as pie
- See what the K value is first before calculating. If it's big (10$^3$), then the reactants are used up completely. 
- If it's small, (10^-3), then the reactants are barely used up. This could mean that for "E," any value that is > 0 can possibly remove the variable due to the change being negligible.
	- Make sure at the end once you calculate x that it is actually negligible (<5% original)
	- This works because sig. figs will make it the same number if the change is very small.


## [[Solubility]]
K(sp) stands for solubility product constant, and like any other K, it has one specific value for a given solid at a certain temperature

- specifically refers to the dissociation reaction of a solid dissolving into its ions.

- **Solubility** is the amount of solid that can dissolve in a given solution (mol/L, g/L)
	- specifically after equilibrium has been reached, and when the solution is  "saturated"

- For equilibrium equations, solubility is the **change in concentration** (C in ICE)
- To put it simply, solubility is the amount of moles that reacted (of the salt)
	- This is just a new term because of the specific solution of dissolution. 

- Two (main) kinds of problems:
	- Given K(sp) and required to calculate **solubility**
		- Molar ratios to get the equilibrium concentrations of the products.
		- Will always be K(sp) = (x)
		
	- Given **solubility/concentrations** and required to calculate K(sp)
		- If given initial concentrations, then I.
		- If given solubility, then C.
		- If given Equilibrium concentrations, then E.
			- ([[ICE Tables]])
		
- For every Solubility problem, always write out the balanced equation (of the dissolution) and set up your Equilibrium Expression first.

##### Common Ion Effect
- if the solvent shares an ion (common ion) with the salt that dissolves, then the reaction will shift to the left because there is already initial concentrations of the ion(s).

- This will reduce the Ksp and the solubility of the salt.

#### Percentage Dissociation
- (amount dissolved)/(original amount) x 100%

#### Lowering pH
- Lowering pH can increase solubility for a salt with a base. 
	- The H$^+$ of the acidic solvent reacts with the base
	- Specifically know that salts with OH$^-$ are an example.
- This shifts the reaction to the right to increase solubility and Ksp of the salt.

#### [[ Precipitation & Equilibrium]]
- Can use equilibrium expressions and [[Le Châtelier’s Principle]] to determine 
1. if precipitate will form
2. the concentrations of the ions that compose the precipitate (bc some dissolve)

- Just get the concentrations of the ions and calculate Q. Compare Q with K, if Q > K, precipitate will form.
- Stoichiometry with the ions to calculate initial equilibrium concentrations. 
- Input into Equilibrium Expression to get final equilibrium concentrations. 

#### Relative Solubilities
- Comparing Ksp values of salts to determine relative solubilities (which one is more soluble)
- We can only compare the Ksp values of salts if the **number of ions formed by the salts are the same**
