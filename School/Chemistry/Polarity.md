- Determined by the types of atoms/ electronegativity values.
- It is ultimately dependent on the arrangements of bonds in a molecule.
	- A nonpolar molecule CAN contain polar bonds


- If a molecules is polar, there will be partial charges (Dipoles -> [[IMF]])
	- The more electronegative atom will pull the electrons closer to it, so the area around it will be partially negative.
	- The less electronegative atom will be partially positive since electrons are away from it.
