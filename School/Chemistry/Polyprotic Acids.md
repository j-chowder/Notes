- Acids that have more than one proton (H$^+$)
- Can lose all of their protons, but will only lose their H+ ions **one at a time.** 
- Each polyprotic acid has two/three dissociation reactions where one H+ falls off, and each reaction has its own K value.

- Each successive K gets smaller
	- K$_1$ > K$_2$ > K$_3$ 

- Why?
	- The conjugate base of the acid gains a negative charge (after losing a H+). According to Coulomb's law, as charge increases, the force of attraction between charged particles increases.  ([[Coulomb's Law]])
	- Thus, after each dissolution step, the attraction between H+ and the rest of the negatively charged molecule increases- the H+ is harder to remove and thus the reaction lies on the left.

#### Equilibrium problems w/ polyprotic acids (weak).
- Same thing as [[Acids and Bases]], the {H+} will be calculated with the largest K (since it provides the majority of it.)
- ! The question might ask for the concentration of a conjugate base in the second or third dissolution of a polyprotic acid.

- I.e. Calculate the pH of a 5.0 M H$_3$PO$_4$ solution, and {HPO$_4$$^2$$^-$}
	- H$_3$PO$_4$ -> H$_2$PO$_4$$^-$ + H$^+$ 
		- Calculate {H+} with this equation
	- H$_2$PO$_4$$^-$  -> HPO$_4$$^2$$^-$ + H$^+$ 
		- Calculate {HPO$_4$$^2$$^-$} with this equation. 
		- Luckily, we already have calculated the concentrations of H$_2$PO$_4$$^-$ and H$^+$ in the previous step to get the pH - now just solve for {HPO$_4$$^2$$^-$}

---
#### Equilibrium problems w/ polyprotic acids (strong)
- A strong polyprotic acid, such as H$_2$SO$_4$, will completely dissociate into H$^+$ and HSO$_4$$^-$.
- The first complete dissociation is the most significant provider of H$^+$, but there is a decent chance that the conjugate base (that still has an H$^+$) will provide enough H+ ions that it can not be rendered negligible like what we do for H$_2$O. 
---
- This is the same thing as how we do the 5% rule, see if you can remove the variable by comparing the final variable value with the original - if >5%, then you have to do quadratic.
- Then with the variable, add it with the initial H+ concentration from the first dissolution.
