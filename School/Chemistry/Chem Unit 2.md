## [[Bonds]]
- ionic:
	- transfer from metal -> nonmetal
- covalent
	- share evenly - identical atoms
	- metallic bonding - metals
- polar-covalent
	- uneven sharing - nonidentical atoms.
	- more electronegative one pulls harder on the electrons.
		- creates slightly polar compounds (slightly negative/positive poles)

## [[Electronegativity]]
- ability to attract shared pair of electrons to itself
- Greater Zeff = Greater Electronegativity.
## [[Polarity]]
- Difference in electronegativity -> electrons are pulled towards one side -> dipoles form.

## [[Covalent Bonding + Bond Length]]

- Anions (-) are bigger than neutral and cations (+)
	- More electrons = more repulsions = Zeff weaker = bigger.

## [[Isoelectronic Atoms]]
- Same # of electrons.
- greater # of protons -> smaller atomic radius.

## [[Lattice Energy]]
- The energy released when solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.
- Greater the attraction between the ions, greater the lattice energy.
- Distance and magnitude of ion charge affect attraction, therefore lattice energy.
	- Shorter atomic radius = nuclei are closer = less distance = more attraction = greater lattice energy.
	- greater ion charge = more attraction = greater lattice energy.


## [[Alloys]]
- mixture of 2+ elements (1 has to be metal)
	- overall metallic properties.
- Interstitial
	- different size atoms -> small one fits in interstices.
- Substitutional
	- similar size atoms replace.


## [[Lewis Structures]]
- [[Octet Rule]]

## [[Resonance]]
- instances where you can place double bonds/triple bonds in different places.
	- the bonds are an average of all the resonance structures - and the properties of the bond order is somewhere between the integer bond orders
		- i.e. 1.333 is stronger and shorter than 1 but weaker and longer than 2.

- Equivalent resonance structures have the same # of bonds and same type of bonds.
- Nonequivalent resonance structures has different # of bonds or different type of bonds.  (But still the same compound)


## [[Formal Charge]]
- Valence - assigned.
- Priority
	1. structure with the most 0's
	2. negative formal charges on most electronegative atoms. 

## [[Localized Electron Theory]]
- electrons are fixed in place b/w specific atoms to form covalent bonds. Those covalent bonds create overlapping orbitals in which the pair of electrons reside in.
- Problems:
	- inaccurate bond angles
	- does not account for multiple bonding.
## [[Hybrid Orbital Theory]]

## [[Sigma, Pi Bonds]]
- Sigma
	- Strong, only 1/bond
- Pi
	- Weak, only in double/triple bond.

## [[Molecular Orbital Theory]]
 - odd electron systems/unpaired electron systems
 - no more resonance structures
 - predicts paramagnetism
