## Kinetic Molecular Theory
- Describes the behavior/traits of ideal gases
	1. Particles are so small that they can just be assumed to have zero volume
	2. Particles are in constant motion - collisions of the particles with the walls of the container causes pressure
	3. No interactions between gas particles
	4. Average kinetic energy of gas particles is assumed to be directly proportional to Kelvin temperature of the gas.
	5. Ideal gases follow the ideal gas law

## Real Gases
- Does not obey the Ideal Gas Law nor the KMT

- For real gases, two KMTs are false:
	- no volume
	- no interactions

- ### Volume
	- The bigger the gas particles, the less ideal the gas is.
		- takes up more space
		- volume available to gas decreases as particle size increases.
	- To make more ideal: **decrease pressure**
		- Results in volume getting bigger
		- A larger volume results in the volume of the gas particles mattering less.

- ## IMFs
	- IMFs will pull and slow down other particles. Particles get stuck on each other or slowed down
		- collides with the container less frequently - so lower pressure.
		- Stronger the IMFs, the less ideal the gas is.
			- stronger pull, even lower pressure.
	- To make more ideal: **increase the temperature**
		- particles will fly faster
		- Particles moving fast arenâ€™t able to pull on other gas particles as effectively
		- Effect of IMFs between particles is reduced.
