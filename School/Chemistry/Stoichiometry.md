- Inherently based on MOLE ratios which come from the coefficients of the balanced equation. 
	- If there are already coefficients, it will be balanced. Otherwise, make sure that it is balanced.

Very easy so long as you keep track of moles and molar ratios.
- You get moles from:
	- Molarity â‹… Volume
	- Mass / Molar Mass
		- Can get from density, etc.
	- PV = nRT

A little twist that they will do is the idea of **limiting reactants.**
- Since a reaction requires sufficient amounts of each reactant, it will often be the case that there will be one reactant with less moles than the rest. 
	- That is the limiting reactant and must use molar ratios to see how much product forms/how much of the other reactants are used RELATIVE to the limiting reactant.
		- Once there is no more LR, the reaction can not progress any further.
- Determine by finding # of moles then dividing by their coefficients. Smallest # is LR.

### Titration
- Application of stoichiometry
- You analyze a solution of unknown concentration (analyte) using a solution of known concentration (titrant)
	- Basically titrate it until you reach the equivalence point. You can then calculate the amount of moles needed to neutralize the analyte (via molar ratio of equation + concentration and volume of titrant) -> which then becomes stoichiometry.
