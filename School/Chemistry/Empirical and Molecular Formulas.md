#### Empirical
- lowest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound
	- Is a ratio

#### Molecular
- actual number of molecules in a compound.


To find molecular formula: 
- (molar mass of compound) / (molar mass of empirical formula) -> multiply with empirical formula.

From % to formula:
1. Turn % to grams 
2. turn to moles (with atomic mass)
3. divide each other by the smallest mole
4. Needs to be whole number so multiply by 2 or 3 if needed
5. Assemble the formula
---
6. If the mass of the compound is different from the mass of the formula, you are finding the molecular formula.
