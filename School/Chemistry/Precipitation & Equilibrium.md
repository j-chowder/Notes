We can apply Equilibrium concepts to precipitation reactions

We can: 
- determine if the precipitate will form
- calculate the concentration of ions that the precipitate dissolves into


Determining if the precipitate will form:
1. The ions that form the precipitate must be present 
2. Q must be greater than Ksp

- Q must be greater than Ksp because that means that the reaction will shift left (and thus allow the ions to reform back into precipitate/solid)
	- Precipitation reactions are dissociation reactions but reversed


So you basically just follow this guideline:
1. Get the concentrations of the individual solutions when they combine together.
	1. Either dilution formula or moles/new volume
2. Plug the concentrations into the Q expression (get it from the dissociation equation)
3. Compare with the Ksp (if Q greater, precipitate will form)

Now to calculate the concentration of ions that the precipitate dissolves into

1. Flip the dissociation reaction so that it is now (ions -> solid). Get the inverse of the K value.
2. If the K value is big, 10$^3$, then the reaction will go to completion.
3. Find the LR of the two ions, see how much of the other ion is remaining.
	1. These are your initial concentrations (I)
		1. REMEMBER TO TURN THE MOLES BACK INTO MOLARITY!!!
4. Stoichiometry/molar ratios to determine (C)
5. Equilibrium concentrations go into the equilibrium expression (E)
