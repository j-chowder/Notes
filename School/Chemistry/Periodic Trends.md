### Ionization Energy (Energy needed to remove an electron)

-    Left --------> Right
	- Increases because of more protons. The addition of extra electrons are in the same principle energy level which only provide somewhat effective repulsions. 
	- Overall, Zeff increases. 
- Down
	- Decreases because the electrons are added to a higher principle level that will receive very effective repulsions from all the electrons that are in lower energy levels. 
	- There are more electrons in lower principal energy levels that provide effective repulsions.
	- Higher energy level > addition of protons.
	- Overall, Zeff decreases.
- ----
- What College Board wants
	- Down:
		- Decreases because the electrons are in a higher principle energy level. 
		- There is a greater average distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons.
		- Greater separation = weaker Coulombic attractions between nucleus and valence electrons.
		- Thus it is easier to remove an electron.

### Atomic radius (size)

-  Left --------> Right
	- Decreases because Zeff increases. The electrons are more attracted to the nucleus so they are bound more tightly to the nucleus.
- Down
	- Increases because Zeff decreases. The electrons are less attracted to the nucleus so they spend more time farther away from the nucleus.

### Metallic character (Desire to lose electrons)

-  Left --------> Right
	- Decreases because it requires more IE.
- Down
	- Increases because it requires less IE. (Fr has the greatest metallic character)

### Electron Affinity (Energy released when electron is added)

- Left --------> Right
	- Increases because Zeff increases. 
	- There is a stronger attraction between electrons and the nucleus so more energy between them.
- Down
	- Decreases because Zeff decreases
	- There is weaker attraction between electrons and the nucleus so less energy.

##### Examples:
- Be has more protons and electrons than Li. However, the valence electrons in Be are still in the same principle energy level, so the target electron does not receive additional effective repulsions. Since Be has more protons than Li, Be has a greater nuclear charge - Zeff increases and the valence electrons are more attracted to the nucleus.

- Na has a smaller IE than Li because Na has more principal energy levels to hold the electrons. The additional electrons experience many more effective repulsions from lower energy levels compared to Li, so Zeff decreases and the target electron is less attracted to the nucleus.

## Inconsistences


#### Group 2 and 3
- i.e. Be and B.
- IE decreases from extra repulsions from the **lower sublevel.** 

- Although B has more protons than Be, the target electron in B is in the 2p sublevel. Its completed 2s sublevel will provide additional effective repulsions to the electron in the 2p sublevel - which decreases the Zeff and results in the 2p electron of B being less attracted to the nucleus. This makes it easier to remove the electron from B than Be, resulting in a lower IE for B.

#### Group 5 and 6
- i.e. N and O
- IE decreases from extra repulsions from being **paired in the same orbital.**

- The electron being removed in O is paired with another electron in the same orbital. That electron provides somewhat effective repulsions to the targeted electron and thus lowers Zeff. Nâ€™s valence electrons all have their own orbitals, so there are no extra effective repulsions.
