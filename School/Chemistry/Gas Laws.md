### Boyle's Law
- P$_1$V$_1$ = P$_2$V$_2$ 
- Pressure and volume of a gas are inversely related

### Charles' Law:
- $V1/T1$ = $V2/T2$
- Volume and temperature of a gas are directly related

### Gay-Lussac's Law
- $P1/T1 = P2/T2$ 
- Pressure and temperature of a gas are directly related

### Avogadro's Law
- $n1/V1 = n2/v2$ 
- Moles and volume of a gas are directly related

---
## Ideal Gas Law:
-  $PV = nRT$ 
	- T in kelvin

- To find partial pressure:
	- Total pressure/ total mole = partial pressure/partial mole

## Graham's Law of Effusion
- Diffusion: particles move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
- Effusion: movement of gas particles through a small hole into an empty chamber

- **The more MASSIVE a particle is, the slower it moves.**

- Since rate is inversely related to time, (think mph).
