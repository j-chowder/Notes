- When atoms form covalent bonds, their orbitals overlap.
	- A pair of electrons is in the overlap region - between the two nuclei.
		- The pair has opposite spins + only two electrons can exist inside.

- Free unbonded atoms have their own s, p, d, and f orbitals.
	- When atoms bond together, they have different valence atomic orbitals.

What are the problems of Localized Electron Theory?
- inaccurate bond angles
- does not account for multiple bonding

- This is important because of specific instances.
	- Carbon only has 2 unpaired electrons - so in theory it can only bond with two other atoms. But it can bond up to 4 atoms in reality. CH$_4$ 
	- Additionally, the bond angles of CH$_4$ are wrong as well: it has bond angles of 90, not 109.5
