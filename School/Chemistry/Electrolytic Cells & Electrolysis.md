### Electrolysis
- The process that happens in an electrolytic cell
	- By using electricity, we get the nonspontaneous reaction to happen.
		- We basically are providing the reaction with electrons so that the reduction half-reaction can occur.

- Current (I)
	- How much charge flows through a circuit in a certain period of time.
	- In Amps (A)
		- Charge per second, A = C/s

- Faraday’s Number (F)
	- Charge on a mole of electrons
		- (96485 C/mol)
	- We use this value to turn the **current** into actual tangible **electrons** that we can use for electrolysis problems.

- Hardest thing is making sure that you have the ratio of electrons to substance correct. Make sure to do the reduction half-reaction properly.

### Selective Plating
- Basically controls how much voltage you apply based off of different reactions' E°
	- You want to apply an x amount of voltage so that plating occurs at g(x) but not at h(x), for g(x) < f(x) < h(x).
