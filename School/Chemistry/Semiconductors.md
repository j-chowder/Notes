- semimetal, properties of both metal and nonmetals.
	- conductivity can be enhanced by doping atoms of other elements to the semiconductor.
	- p-type, n-type.

- p-type
	- the host has been replaced with an element containing **fewer valence electrons**.
	- remember: p has a hole.
		- creates holes that act as **empty spaces in orbitals.** Electrons will move to fill in a hole, thus creating more holes and the process repeating itself.
		- Since electrons are constantly moving, mobile charges are created.
- n-type
	- the host replaced with an element containing **more valence electrons.**
		- creates extra electrons that are free to move around.
		- These act as mobile charges.
