### The number of valence electrons on the free atom - the number of valence electrons assigned to the atom in the molecule.
- To determine the resonance structure that is the most similar to the actual molecular structure. The "preferred" Lewis Structure.

#### Finding Formal Charge
- On the Lewis structure, add up
	- the lone pairs on the atom 
	- half of the shared electrons around the atom.
- Subtract from the element's valence electrons on the PT.
- Formal charge = valence - assigned

- The sum of the formal charges on all the atoms in a molecule or ion must equal the overall charge on that molecule.

#### Choosing
- Choose the resonance structure that follows these rules (with priority)
	- Formal charges are closest to 0 (the structure with the most 0's)
	- Negative formal charges are on the most electronegative atoms.
