#### In going from a particular set of reactants to a particular set of products, the change in enthalpy ($\triangle$H) is the same regardless of the steps.

- ##### $\triangle$H is a "state function: it is path-way independent"

---
- Hess's Law problems are always indicated by multiple equations of $\triangle$H
	- Whatever equations given, will ALWAYS use but ONLY ONCE

- Reversing a reaction:
	- change the sign for $\triangle$H
- Multiply the coefficients by a value "n"
	- multiply $\triangle$H by "n"


- Steps:
1. Find elements in the given equations that only appear once
2. Then try to cancel an erroneous compound - look for a reaction that has the same one and then manipulate it so it gets cancelled.
3. Repeat: add/cancel as needed.
4. If combined, it should equal the same reaction overall: then add all $\triangle$H together.

- KEEP TRACK OF $\triangle$H SIGNS.
