#### The measure of the driving force on the electrons (to cause a reaction to happen)
- also known as: electromotive force (emf), voltage, potential.

Each half reaction of a redox in galvanic cell has its own half cell potential.
- (in the circumstances of 1 M, 1 atm, 25°C)

- E° > 0 = spontaneous
- E° < 0 = nonspontaneous 

	- For a reduction half-reaction,
		- Greater the E°, easier the reduction half-reaction is at **gaining electrons.**
		- Which means the better it is as an oxidizing agent (someone that steals electrons)
	- For an oxidation half-reaction
		- Greater the E°, easier the oxidation half-reaction is at **losing electrons**
		- Which means the better it is as a reducing agent.

[[Hess's Law]] for E°

- Since electrochemistry revolves around redox reactions, (galvanic: spontaneous, electrolysis: nonspontaneous), 
	- There will be 1 oxidation half-reaction and 1 reduction half-reaction. (Give and take)
		- So, will need to switch the reduction half-reactions with the provided E° into its oxidation half-reaction. (Which is just the reverse reaction)

- Reversing the reaction
	- Switch the sign of E°
- Multiplying/changing the coefficients
	- E° does not change - because it is a ratio. (J/coulomb)

Creating a Galvanic Cell
- E° has to be positive ( > 0 ) because Galvanic cells revolve around spontaneous redox reactions.
	- Because one reaction has to be reduction, and one reaction has to be oxidation,
	- Just flip the equation that would make the E°(cell) > 0.
- Similarly, do the opposite if you're asked to create an Electrolytic cell. 
	- [[Electrolytic Cells & Electrolysis ]]

- E° = 0 when the salt bridge is missing. Because the salt bridge allows for the migration of ions to maintain electrical neutrality in each half-cell. No salt bridge = not neutral = no driving force for the reaction to occur.

∆G° = -nFE°
- ∆G in joules
- n = # of moles of electrons.
- F = 96,485 C/mol e- (charge on a mole of electrons)

- Relates Free Energy with Cell Potential
