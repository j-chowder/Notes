### Ability of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons to itself
#### Trends
- Same thing as IE ([[Periodic Trends]])
	- Down 
		- Electrons are placed into higher principle energy levels -> Zeff decreases.
	- Left ----> Right
		- addition of protons > addition of electrons. -> Zeff increases.
- Greater Zeff -> electron are more attracted to the nucleus -> greater electronegativity.


### Electronegativity Values
- x = 0 = covalent bond
- 0 < x < 1.7 = polar covalent
- x â‰¥ 1.7 = ionic bond.

- Fluorine has electronegativity value of 4.0
	- Can be easier to compare/estimate electronegativity by seeing how close an element is to Fluorine.
- Noble gases = 0 electronegativity.
	- They have a complete octet already so they are content without any extra.
