- If a reaction is going to happen, something has to occur for it to happen: **Particles/molecules have to collide to react.**

- However, not all collisions result in a reaction:
	1. Collisions must have sufficient energy to produce the reaction (activation energy).

	2. Collision has to happen in such a way that the correct bonds can form.
		- The relative orientation of the reactants when they collide must allow formation of any new bonds necessary to produce products.
