## The amount of work that is required to make a reaction happen, OR The amount of work that a reaction can produce.
## $$∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°$$

#### Used to determine spontaneity

- ∆G < 0 = spontaneous
- ∆G > 0 = nonspontaneous 
- ∆G = 0 = system at equilibrium

- The signs of ∆G are opposite for the forward and reverse reactions.
	- One direction is spontaneous, the other is not.
		- Which makes sense: one reaction rate is always favored (unless at equilibrium)

Where ∆H = heat (endo vs. exo), T = temperature,  ∆S = disorder/order
- ° refers to standard states
- T = K
- ∆G and ∆H in kJ/mol or J/mol
- ∆S = Joules/K  x mol

---
∆H 
- +∆H: Endothermic processes oppose spontaneity
	- because if energy is needed for a reaction to occur, it is not spontaneous 
- -∆H: Exothermic processes promote spontaneity ( products are at a lower energy state)

∆S
- +∆S: promotes spontaneity 
- -∆S: opposes spontaneity.

### Different methods of calculating ∆G
- (For reactions at constant temperature)
	- ∆G = ∆H - T∆S
- Adaptation of Hess’s Law
	-  [[Hess's Law]]. Note that manipulating ∆G shares the same pattern as ∆H - only manipulating K is different.  [[Equilibrium Constant, K]]
- ∆G$_f$° 
	- Using standard free energy of formation. [[Standard Enthalpy of Formation]]
-  ∆G° = -RTlnK

### Free Energy and Equilibrium

- The greater the magnitude of ∆G (when it is negative), the greater the spontaneity is. It lies further to the right.
	- We can actually prove this with the formula right below. **K increases the greater the magnitude of ∆G is.** 
- The greater the magnitude of ∆G (when it is positive), the further to the left it lies. (So so less spontaneous it is)


- ∆G° = -RTlnK
	- **∆G HAS TO BE IN JOULES.** 
	- R = 8.1345 Joules/Mole * Kelvin
	- T = Kelvin
	- K = equilibrium constant

- Spontaneous processes can DO WORK. (because work is not required for it)
	- i.e. if ∆G = -700 kJ, it can ideally do 700 kJ of work (at most)

- Negative:
	- ∆G is related to the amount of work it can do at most.
- Positive
	- ∆G is related to the amount of minimal work it needs to react.

- So, when something is nonspontaneous, work is required for it to happen.
- You can provide this work with
	- electricity
	- light
	- nuclear
- A nonspontaneous reaction can be coupled with a spontaneous reaction
	- Using chemical energy to provide the work.
	- Which is [[Galvanic Cells]]
