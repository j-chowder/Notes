##### Calorimetry involves changes in temperature to figure out the $\triangle$H.
---
## Q = sm($\triangle$T)
- Q = heat flow (J)
	- (same as q from [[Internal Energy & Work]])
- s = specific heat capacity (J/gram * C) or (J/mol * C)
- m = mass (grams/moles)
- $\triangle$T = change in temperature

#### When heat is transferred, energy lost by one system is gained by another.
