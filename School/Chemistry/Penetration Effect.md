- Ability of an electron to be closer to the nucleus than its probable distance
	- The degree depends on the electron's "radial distribution"

- The high peaks are the most probable distances where the electrons are usually located.
	- The smaller peaks are the areas of penetration

### Filling Order
- Penetration is responsible for the order in which orbitals fill up with electrons
	- Why orbitals fill up in the order s, p, d, f.
- Explains why 3d orbitals fill up after 4s orbitals.
- "The 2s orbital fills before the 2p orbital because electrons in the 2s orbital penetrate closer to the nucleus than the 2p orbital."
