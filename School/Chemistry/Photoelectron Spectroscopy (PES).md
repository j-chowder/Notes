- Evidence that sublevels exist in multi-electron atoms
	- X-rays shot at the atom that causes the electrons to escape.
	- Machine detects the energy of these electrons and creates graphs.

- Y-axis:
	- amount of electrons that each peak (sublevel) has.
		- Make sure that each peak accurately portrays the relative # of electrons.
			- So 2p$^6$ is 3x taller than 2s$^2$ 
- X-axis
	- amount of energy than the sublevel contains.
		- 0 on the right because further the sublevel is from the nucleus, the less energy they have (the less energy that an electron in that sublevel needs to be removed)
	- 1s is farthest to left (and thus has the most energy) because it is 
		- closest to the nucleus (greatest attraction)
		- receives the least amount of very effective repulsions.

- Used to determine:
	- what the element is (by looking at the electron config)
	- what the element is (by comparing relative positions on the graph with a different PES for a different element)
		- Further to the left = Greater Zeff. (Requires more energy to remove the electron)
