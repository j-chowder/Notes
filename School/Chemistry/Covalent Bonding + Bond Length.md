- Between two atoms, there are:
	- proton-electron attractions
	- proton-proton repulsions
	- electron-electron repulsions.

- These all ultimately affect the bond length
	- The distance between nuclei of two bonded atoms.

1. No interactions between atoms since they are far apart.
2. As atoms get closer, attractions grow faster than repulsions; attractions outweigh repulsions causing a **net attraction.** 
	- Both are growing (due to [[Coulomb's Law]]) but attraction > repulsion
3. Maximum net attraction (bond length measured)
4. Closer than max net attraction -> repulsions grow faster than attraction.
	- Once cross the x-axis, there is net repulsion.

##### Comparing:
- If there are multiple curves of different substances.
- Two ways to go about it:
	- Compare their positions on the x-axis (their intermolecular distance)
		- atoms with smaller atomic radiuses = shorter distance = further to the left.
		- higher bond order = two atoms are closer = shorter distance = further to the left.
	-  ==Compare their positions on the y-axis (energy) ==
		- higher bond order = higher bond energy = lower dip on the point (3).

## Bond Energy
- amount of energy required to break a chemical bond
- amount of energy released when the bond is formed.

- Triple bond > Double Bond > Single Bond.

- Bond length is inversely proportional to bond energy.
	- Greater bond energy = Shorter bond length.
	- Think: Stronger bond = bonding electrons of atom A is more attracted to nucleus of atom B = shorter bond length.
	- Think: Weaker bond = bonding electrons of atom A is less attracted to nucleus of atom B = longer bond length.
