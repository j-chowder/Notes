Review [[Titration]] if needed (from [[Chem Unit 4]])

### Titration Curve/pH Curve
- Plotting the pH of the solution being analyzed as a function of the amount of titration added.
- In which the titrant is a strong acid/base

## Titration w/ strong analyte
Overall steps:
1. Major species
	1. Turn concentrations into moles using (concentration)(volume) of their independent solutions first. 
	2. i.e. 100 mL of 0.400 M NH3 w/ 0.200 HNO3 (adding 50.0 mL HNO3)
		1. 0.04 moles of NH3 and 0.01 moles of HNO3
2. Check to see if anything reacts to completion (do stoichiometry if needed)
3. Recalculate concentrations
4. Solve for pH 


## Titration w/ weak analyte
- Same thing as w/ strong analyte except:
	- Because it is a weak substance, will need to do ICE box/pH = pka + log(base/acid)
	- Equivalence Point is not 7.00 because the weak CB/CA forms that is a more significant pH provider than water. Thus we have to ICE box for the conjugate to calculate pH.
	- Halfway Point - the concentration of your acid and the CB is equal. pH = pka.

- I recommend for the first titration (where none is added) to use ICE Box.
- Then for the subsequent ones, use pH = pka + log(base/acid)
	- because the concentrations of the CB and the weak acid are known.

#### Polyprotic Acids
- The distance from start to the first equivalence point is the same distance as that from the first to second equivalence point.

Notes:
- We can use Henderson Hasselbalch Equation - or more specifically, the pH compared to the pka to determine the ratio of base to acid.
	- I.e. if the pH > pKa, it means that there is more conjugate base in the substance than there is acid.
		- Think: HA -> A$^-$ as titrant is added. After the halfway point and before the equivalence point is where A$^-$ > HA. Before the halfway point, HA > A$^-$
