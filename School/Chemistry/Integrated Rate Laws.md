#### Expresses the relationship between concentration and time

-  Reactions with different orders have different integrated rate laws.
	- But if you know the order for the reaction, you can write the differential and integrated rate laws. 


First Order
- ln{A} = -kt + ln{A}$_0$ 
	- ln{A} = concentration in respect to time
	- ln{A}$_0$ = initial concentration
	- k's time unit has to match with the time unit of "t"
	- any unit for {A} except for grams
- Slope (for a straight line) = -k

Second Order
- 1/{A} = kt + 1/{A}$_0$ 
- Sloper = k

Zero Order
- {A} = -kt + {A}$_0$ 
- Slope = -k

#### Half-Life
- the time it takes for half the original concentration to react
- At t$_1$$_/$$_2$, {A} = {A}$_0$ /2
- Half life equation:
	- t$_1$$_/$$_2$ = 0.693/k

- Types of questions:
	- Half life of reaction is given (how long it took to get to half). Solve for rate constant.
		- 0.693/k = x time.
	- Half life given. How long will it take to reach 75%.
		- 75% is two half-lives, so (x time) â‹… 2
	- How long will it take the reaction to be 89% (random # that requires actual calculation) complete?
		1. We know the k value via part a.
		2. since {A}$_0$ and {A} are relative, set them up at percentages.
			- {A}$_0$ is 100(%); {A} is X% remaining.
			- For this specific problem, {A} = 11(%) when the reaction is 89% complete.
		3. Now solve for time.
