### "Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another." -Law of Conservation of Energy


## [[Internal Energy & Work]]

- IE = KE + PE
- $\triangle$E = q + w
	- Internal energy change = heat + work
	- work being done on system; w > 0
	- work being done by system; w < 0
-  w = -P($\triangle$V)
	- compression/expansion of gas


## [[Energy Stoichiometry]]

- Use stoichiometry to get the amount of $\triangle$H released per x of y

## [[Calorimetry]]

- q = sm$\triangle$T


## [[Bond Energy]]
 $\triangle$H = $\Sigma$ D (bonds broken) - $\Sigma$ D (bonds formed)

## [[Hess's Law]]
-  In going from a particular set of reactants to a particular set of products, the change in enthalpy ($\triangle$H) is the same regardless of the steps.
	- Given lots of reactions with their respective $\triangle$H.
	- First, look for elements that only show up once (in the various reactions)
	- Then, look to cancel the excess.
	- Rinse and repeat.
