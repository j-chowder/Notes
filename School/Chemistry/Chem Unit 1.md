## [[Terminology Chem]]

## [[Mass Spectrometry & Isotopes]]
- Isotopes: atoms of the same element with just different # of neutrons
- Mass Spectrometry is a graph of an element's common isotopes and their relative abundance
	- Average mass of an element is calculated w/ this graph by $\Sigma$(mass)(%) 


## [[Elemental Composition]]
- mass of part/mass of whole â‹… 100%

## [[Empirical and Molecular Formulas]]
- empirical is ratio
- molecular is actual
- to find molecular with the empirical formula: 
	- get the ratio of molecular/empirical, multiply with the formula.

## [[Modern Atomic Theory]]
- Heisenberg
	- Can not know location + speed/energy at the same time of an electron.
- Bohr Model
	- violates Heisenberg
	- Math for electron energies of elements are wrong except for H
- Schrodinger
	- electrons had wave properties
	- orbital shapes discovered
- [[Coulomb's Law]]
	- stronger charge, stronger attraction
	- closer distance, stronger attraction
	- opposites attract
	- like repels

## [[Polyelectronic Atoms & Zeff & Repulsions]]
- Zeff = Effective Nuclear Charge = net attraction that an electron experiences w/ nucleus
	- affected by # of protons in nucleus 
	- and effectiveness and # of repulsions from other electrons.
- effective repulsions:
	- lower energy levels (relative to target electron)
- ineffective repulsions:
	- higher energy levels (relative to target electron)
- somewhat effective repulsions
	- same energy level
- Shielding
	- term for basically just that electrons denying target electron from full attraction of nucleus. 
	- Basically: "blocking" or "shielding" full attraction towards nucleus.

## [[Penetration Effect]]
- Electrons are always moving
- They can "penetrate" closer to the nucleus
- Is responsible for the order in which orbitals fill up with electrons
	- electrons will fill in the 2s orbital first because the 2s orbital penetrates closer to the nucleus than the 2p orbital

## [[Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)]]
- electron configuration of an element graphed.
	- y-axis = # of electrons per sublevel
	- x-axis = energy
		- 0 on the rightest of the x-axis (must be labelled)
		- peaks are more to the left if greater Zeff

## [[Periodic Trends]]
- IE
	- Increases from left to right
		- Addition of protons > addition of electrons 
		- The electrons are added in the same principle energy level.
	- Decreases down
		- Addition of protons < addition of electrons
		- The electrons are added to higher principle energy levels.
- Groups 2-3
	- 3 has lower IE than 2
		- electron in 3 is in a new higher sublevel
			- receives effective repulsions from lower sublevel
- Groups 5-6
	- 6 has lower IE than 5
		- electron in 6 is paired with another in the same orbital
			- target electron receives effective repulsions from the other in the same orbital.
