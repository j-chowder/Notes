Internal Energy (IE) is the sum of the Kinetic Energy (KE) and the Potential Energy (PE) in a system.

### Internal Energy ($\triangle$E)
- Internal energy only changes through **heat flow (q) and work (w)**
	- $\triangle$E = q + w
		- $\triangle$E is always from the system's POV (i.e. if the system gains energy then $\triangle$ is positive)
	- $\triangle$E < 0 when energy flows out of the system into the surroundings
	- $\triangle$E > 0 when energy flows from the surroundings into the system.

#### Heat flow (q)
- q > 0 when endothermic
- q < 0 when exothermic


#### Work (w)
- w < 0 when work is done by the system
	- Think: system works on surroundings and gives it energy
	- When gas expands, work is being done BY the system
- w > 0 when work is done on the system
	- Think: surroundings work on system and gives it energy
	- When gas is compressed, work is being done ON the system.

#### PV Work
- PV work is the work associated with gasses: compression and expansion.
- W = -p($\triangle$V)
	- where p is external pressure (atm) and $\triangle$V is change in volume (L)
	- W has units of L x atm 
		- If need to convert to joules, (101.3 J = 1 L * atm).
