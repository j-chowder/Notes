Spectral Analysis is analyzing the EMR absorbed and emitted from a substance.

### Electronic Energy Level Transitions
- **Visible or UV light** at a molecule, we can make an electron jump up an energy level.

#### Molecular Vibrational Transitions
- **Infrared (IR) radiation**, physical shifts in molecular bonds.
	- Lower frequency/lower energy than visible and UV light.
	- Donâ€™t have enough energy to excite an electron in a molecule.

#### Molecular Rotational Transitions
- **microwaves**, can rotate/change the axis that the molecule is spinning on.
	- don't have enough energy to cause vibrational transitions or electronic energy level transitions.
