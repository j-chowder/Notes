- Shows how different temperatures affect the distribution of particles' speeds in liquids/gases
	- Not all particles are moving at the same speeds 
- Each curve shows how many particles have a certain amount of energy at one temperature
- As you decrease the temperature
	- particles moving slower - range of possible speeds decreases
		- peaks shoot upwards because more particles will have similar speeds
- Higher temperature and the hill gets flatter
	- more equal distribution of speeds/energy
	- "Average speed of the molecules increases"
