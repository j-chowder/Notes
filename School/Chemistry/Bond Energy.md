- Bond energy is the amount of energy:
	- stored in a chemical bond
	- required to break a specific bond
	- released when atoms form a specific bond.

- Breaking bonds is endothermic process while forming bonds is an exothermic process
	- Think: need energy to break, thus why breaking is endothermic.

## $\triangle$H = $\Sigma$ D (bonds broken) - âˆ‘ D (bonds formed)
- D = bond energy per moles of bonds (which is always positive)

- look at Lewis structures to identify the bond level; single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds all have different energy levels.
- Make sure to multiply the D by the respective coefficients every time.
