- Series of elementary steps by which a reaction happens.
	- Mechanisms are only theories

- Criteria to be valid 
	- **Slowest** mechanism step's **rate law** has to be the same as the **overall.** 
		- Look for the step that is labelled "slow".
			- Rate = k{A}$^x${B}$^y$
				- in which A and B are reactants of the slow step
				- x and y are the coefficients of A and B, respectively.

	- Has to add up to equal the overall reaction.
		- Cancel same things that are on the opposite side of the equations.

If rate law does not match
- If the step above the slow step is a fast **equilibrium step**, there is a possibility that the mechanism is still valid.
- If there is, this is what you will do:
	1. Write the rate laws for both the forward and backward reaction of the equilibrium.
	2. Set them equal to each other
	3. Treat them as variables and solve for the other substance.

	4. If there is ANOTHER fast equilibrium step above the previous equilibrium step, it may be necessary to do steps 1-3 AGAIN to get the actual rate law
		- If at the end, this rate law matches the overall, the mechanism is valid.

Types of Questions
1. When do you do a substitution?
	- The rate order of the slowest step does not match the overall rate order, and when there is a fast equilibrium step directly above it.
2. What do you substitute for?
	- You substitute for the concentration that matches the overall order's rate law - using the concentration that does not match.

3. What do you do with all the Ks?
	- You can just group it all together - constant and a bigger constant is just constant.

- Intermediates:
	- Substances that are first formed (product) then used up (reactant) during the reaction.
		- They are neither reactants nor products (in the overall) since they are formed and used up in the middle.

- Catalysts
	- Substances that are first consumed (already present in the reactant and is used up) then reformed (in the product).
		- Neither reactants nor products (in the overall) since they are used up then reformed in the middle.

Step 1: 
- Cl + O$_3$ -> ClO + O$_2$
Step 2:
- ClO + O -> Cl + O$_2$ 

- Cl is catalyst
- ClO is intermediate.
