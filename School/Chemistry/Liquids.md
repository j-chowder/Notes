### Surface Tension
- Liquid droplets forming into beads/spherical shape
- Only occurs for polar liquids - stronger IMF, higher ST
- Happens because liquid molecules near the surface of the liquid feel attraction only from molecules within the body - so those molecules will be pulled towards the center of the liquid.
	- But, liquid molecules in the center of the water body experience attractions everywhere - aren't pulled in any specific direction.

### Viscosity
- Liquid's resistance to flow (more viscous = less flow)
- Stronger IMFs = greater attractions between liquid molecules. 
	- Won't flow as quickly because want to stick together more than want to slide past each other
- Weak IMFS = smaller attractions
	- less attracted to other molecules so slide past each other more easily

### Capillary Action
- Spontaneous rising of a liquid in a narrow tube.
- Happens because of cohesive forces and adhesive forces
	- Cohesion: IMFs among liquid molecules that hold the liquid together
	- Adhesion: IMFs between liquid molecules and their container.
		- Think: liquid attracted to container so wants to creep up and maximize their surface area to the container
		- Only with polar containers.

### Meniscus
- When cohesive forces are stronger than adhesive forces
	- liquid will form a convex meniscus (hill-shape).
	- Liquid molecules will prefer to cling to each other instead of the container
- When cohesive forces are weaker than adhesive forces
	- liquid will form a concave meniscus (bowl-shape).
	- Liquid molecules will be attracted to container because the molecules don't feel the need to cling to each other as much.
	- Will try to climb up the walls of the container, explaining why the center becomes a valley-shape.


### Melting
- Happens when molecules overcome their IMFs enough to be able to slide past each other.
- In some cases, bonds need to be broken in order for particles to slide past each other ([[Solids]])

- When a solid melts, density decreases:
	- the average distance between molecules is greater in the liquid state than in the solid state. Thus, the same number of molecules occupies a larger volume, and the density decreases.




### Boiling
- Happens when molecules overcome their IMFs or bonds even more to allow molecules to completely separate from each other
- Bonds are NOT broken when molecular solids are vaporized.
	- i.e. water does not vaporize into H$^+$ and OH$^-$; it vaporizes into water vapor.


==In both melting and boiling, IMFs are still present (they do not just disappear); the molecules just simply had enough energy to overcome these attractions/IMFs to start travelling the world alone==

### Evaporation vs. Boiling
| Evap | Boil |
| ---- | ---- |
| Occurs only as the surface of <br>a liquid | Occurs throughout the<br>liquid |
| Can occur at any temperature | Must occur above or at the boiling point |

### Vapor Pressure
- the pressure of a gas above its own liquid in a sealed container
	- measured when the rate of evaporation and the rate of condensation are equal.
- For a pure liquid:
	- vapor pressure is dependent ONLY on temperature
		- higher temperature -> molecules w/ more energy + moving faster -> higher chance of turning into gaseous molecules
		- lower temp -> less energy + moving slower -> fewer molecules into gas
- For mixture of different liquids:
	- vapor pressure is dependent on IMFs
		- The weaker the IMF between different liquid molecules, the less attracted the molecules are to each other 
			- (higher vapor pressure since easier to escape into a gas)
		- The stronger the IMF, the more molecules are attracted to each other instead of escape.
			- (so lower vapor pressure since hard to escape into a gas)
