## [[IMF]]
- LDF
	- only IMF in non-polar; is present in everything.
	- scales with # of electrons
	- Due to instantaneous and induced dipoles
- DDA
	- IMF only in polar
	- From permanent dipoles
- HB
	- Strong type of dipole-dipole
	- H-O, H-N, H-F, connected to O, N, F.
	- Usually the strongest unless LDF of a steroids atom

## [[Liquids]]
1. Surface tension 
	1. stronger IMF, stronger ST
2. Viscosity
	1. stronger IMF, more viscous
3. Capillary Action
	1. mix of adhesion and cohesion
4. Meniscus
	1. greater cohesion, hill shape
	2. greater adhesion, valley shape
- Boiling (vs. vaporization)
	- molecules overcome IMF to separate
- Melting
	- molecules overcome IMF to slide past each other
- Vapor Pressure
	- pressure of gas above liquid
	- pure liquids: higher temp, higher VP
	- mixture of liquids: higher IMF, lower VP

## [[Network Solids]]
- Strong, directional covalent bonds b/w carbon, silicon, or silicon w/ oxygen.
- high melting point, brittle, and poor conductors of heat/electricity.
- Diamond
	- carbon atom is 3D bonded with strong directional covalent bonds
	- structure is one large covalently bonded molecule
	- hard and rigid
- Graphite
	- carbon atom is 2D bonded 
	- structure is multiple planes of carbon rings that are weakly bonded together
	- soft

## [[Semiconductors]]
- p-type
	- replaced with element containing fewer valence electrons
	- makes holes that need to be filled
		- which causes mobile charges
- n-type
	- replaced with element containing more valence electrons
		- creates extra electrons that are free to move around

## [[Biomolecules]]
- IMFs may occur between different molecules/ different parts of the same molecule - when itâ€™s really big

## [[Gas Laws]]

## [[Kinetic Molecular Theory & Real Gases]]
1. zero volume
2. constant motion; collisions of the particles causes pressure
3. no interactions between gas particles
4. average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to Kelvin temperature of gas
---
- For real gases, zero volume and no IMFs are wrong
	- Volume
		- the bigger the gas particle is, the less ideal the gas is (takes up more space)
		- To make more ideal: decrease pressure (so volume gets bigger)
	- IMFs
		- IMFs do pull and slow down other particles. Collides with the container less frequently so the pressure is actually lower
		- Stronger the IMFs, the less ideal the gas is. (stronger pull = lower pressure)
		- To make more ideal: increase temperature (so particles fly faster and ignore IMFs more)

### Part 2

## [[Solutions]]
- Factors affecting solubility:
	- Similar molecular structure
	- Gases:
		- higher pressure = higher solubility
		- higher temperature = lower solubility
	- Solids:
		- higher temperature = higher solubility

## [[Distillation & Chromatography]]
- Distillation is based on the the differences of **boiling points.**
- Chromatography is based on the difference in the attraction of components for a mobile vs. stationary phase.

## [[EMR & Spectroscopy]]
- EMR waves are at the speed of light
- wavelengths are the distance between peaks
	- has to be in meters
- frequency is the amount of waves that pass a point in certain time
	- has to be in s$^-$$^1$ 

## [[Spectral Analysis]]
- Electronic Energy Level Transitions
	- Visible/UV light
- Molecular Vibrational Transitions
	- IR
- Molecular Rotational Transitions
	- microwaves

## [[Photoelectric Effect]]
- Specific threshold frequency to emit electrons
- more electrons are emitted the greater the intensity is 
- KE of the electrons increases as frequency of the light increases

## [[Spectrophotometry]]
- A = abc
	- a is molar absorptivity constant
	- b is path length
	- c is concentration
- Greater the concentration, greater the absorption.
