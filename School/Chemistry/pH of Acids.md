#### Major species: 
- What is present in large quantities in the system.
- Used to figure out which substance contributes the greatest amount of H+ / OH-

#### Equilibrium problems w/ Acids to get pH
- Exact same thing as equilibrium problems in [[Chem Unit 7]], however one step further by turning the H+ concentration that you calculate and calculating pH with it.

Steps:
1. Identify the largest K value of the H+ providers; this will be the one that you solve the equilibrium expression for the determine H+ concentration.
	1. Note that H$_2$O is both an H+ and OH- provider, so be aware that there is more than one H+ provider and that there is always OH- present.
	2. Only calculate for the largest Ka value acid because the H+ ions from the rest of the acids/water will not be significant enough to affect the final calculation.
3. [[ICE Tables]]
4. Plug into equilibrium expression, always try 5% rule on weak acids, remember that you the equilibrium expression contains the acid as well (in the denominator)

5. Now that you have the H+ concentration of the solution, you can:
		1.  calculate pH 
			1. pH = -log{H+}
		2. calculate concentrations of other ions (from a different acid in the solution)
			1. You do not need to set up another ICE table, just set up the equilibrium expression (with the Ka of the acid) and use the H+ concentration calculated prior. 
		3. calculate {OH$^-$}
			1. pH way:
				1. pH + pOH = 14
				2. pOH = -log{OH-}
			2. k$_w$ way
				1. kw = {H+}{OH-}
				2. 1.0 x 10^-14 = {H+}{OH-}
					1. put in the H+ value calculated prior.
