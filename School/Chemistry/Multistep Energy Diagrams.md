- Each hill represents an elementary step
- Each step has its own
	- activated complex/transition state
	- activation energy
	- $\triangle$H
- There is an overall activation energy and $\triangle$H for the whole diagram.
	- The overall activation energy is the vertical distance from the ACTUAL reactants to the tallest hill on the graph.
	- The overall $\triangle$H is the vertical distance from the start of the graph -> end of the graph.
	

- Every step creates "products" from "reactants"
	- Each step forms intermediates (valley), which is their "product"
	- These intermediates then act as the "reactants" for the next step.


-  The ==rate-determining step== is the individual step with the largest activation energy
	- Do not mix this up with overall activation energy.
	- Largest activation energy in this context means from their respective reactants to its peak; not the actual initial reactants.
