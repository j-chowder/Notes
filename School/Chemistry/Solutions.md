- contain solute and solvent
- ionic compounds dissolve in water because the ions in ionic compounds are pulled apart and stabilized by the polar water molecules

## **Solution formation**
- Steps happen simultaneously:
	1. expanding the solute
		- bonds broken/IMFs will be overcome.
		- Solute particles separate into individual ions.
	2. expanding the solvent
		- bonds break/IMFS are overcome
		- solvent particles dissociate completely
	3. Interaction of the solute and solvent to form the solution.

## Factors affecting solubility
- Molecular structure
	- The more similar the two substances are in terms of polarity, the more attracted the particles are to each other, so they are more easily dissolved.
		- If we mix a nonpolar solute with a polar solvent, the solute won’t dissolve because the polar solvent has stronger IMFs between itself than it does with the nonpolar solute, so it won’t expand to accommodate the solute

- Pressure 
	- No effect on solids/liquids, but big effect on solubility of gases.
		- higher the pressure, the greater the solubility of the gas.
		- Higher pressure just means that gas particles are more densely packed (above a solution)
			- So they have less space to move around and thus enter the solution.

- Temperature
	- For most solids/liquids, solubility increases as temperature increases.
		- However, sometimes there are exceptions (no way to tell)
	- For gases:
		- Higher temperature = lower solubility of gas.
		- understand by: “increasing temperature means that dissolved gas particles will have more energy to overcome IMFs and thus escape the solution.”
