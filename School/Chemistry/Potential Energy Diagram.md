When drawing:
- Exothermic curves 
	- Start high, end low
- Endothermic curves
	- start low, end high.

- Make sure to label reactants and products on the graph itself
- Make sure to label y-axis with "potential energy" and x-axis with "reaction progress."

---
- The tip of the "hill" represents the potential energy of the activated complex.
	- Activated complex: the transition state of the atoms.
	- Contains a lot of energy since the atoms are stuck "in-between" reactant molecules and product molecules. 

- Catalysts lower the activation energy in a reaction (makes the hill shorter)
	- Via providing alternate pathways
