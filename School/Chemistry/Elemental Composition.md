#### Percent Composition
- the relative amount of each element present in a compound
- So (mass of element)/(mass of compound) ⋅ 100%
	- The percent composition is the percent by mass of each element in a compound.

#### Mass Percent
- relative amount of an element/compound/ion in a sample by **weight** (mass)
- So (mass of part)/(mass of whole) ⋅ 100%

They are basically the same thing; mass percent is broader than percent composition.
