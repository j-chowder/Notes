- When more or one valid Lewis Structure can be drawn for a particular model
	- i.e. when you have 2+ bonds that can change places or change bond orders in a molecule.


- The actual structure is an average of the resonance structure.
	- so not 2 single bonds, 1 double bond. Rather, has 3 identical bonds with the same length and strength. 
		- These bonds will be shorter and stronger than single bonds, but longer and weaker than double bonds.
		- These bonds are also nondirectional (the electrons are delocalized)

### Equivalent vs. Non-Equivalent

- Same # of bonds and type of bond = equivalent.

#### Isomers
- Molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.
