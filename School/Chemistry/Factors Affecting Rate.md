How to increase the rate of a reaction

1. Increase temperature (always)
	- More energy (Boltzmann distribution)
		- This is portrayed on the Boltzmann with more of the graph to the right of the E$_a$ **![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/8UEwsRbgxGJnO_CUfNpApuFpibsE0rHUVeQ0SMQjXvOsAmg36OUAoFE7MvQbwiKKOUcMSIsJ-d5MOlPcF-uQfwf2i-A56kfx5eGAHvMdjzdw-Sp1WIiIxnulxIj-MecSvYmv-egZa-W8HBOkY1EEcDM)**
	- Collide more frequently (more KE -> move faster)

2. Increase surface area
	- more places to collide with, increases collision so higher chance of forming the right orientation.
	- Increase surface area by breaking into smaller pieces.

3. Increasing concentration usually increases the rate of a reaction.
	- More particles so more chance of reaction

4. Presence of Catalysts
	- Lowers the activation energy by providing alternate pathways.
		- Basically makes the requirement lower; shifts the E$_a$ to the left in terms of the Boltzmann Distribution graph.
