- The change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit of time.
	- For reactants: rate of disappearance
	- For Products: rate of appearance.
- (final concentration of A - initial concentration of A)/(change in time)
	- Must be positive; so in the case of reactant -> absolute value.

---
- Rates are proportional stoichiometrically.
	- Rates are related based on their mole ratios/coefficients.
		- I.e. Products: 2NO + 1O$_2$.  NO would be appearing at twice the rate of O$_2$ 

- Slope determines rate.
	- Reaction rates are equal to the slope tangent to that point.
	- But rates are not constant; that is why you need to find the derivative rather than the slope.
