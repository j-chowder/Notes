- The structure of an acid affects how strong it is (how easily it donates protons)
	- Moreover, we can use the structure to explain why an H$^+$ of a molecule is acidic or not.

- Factors:
	- Bond Strength (Weaker bond = stronger acid)
		- Think: weak bond = bond breaking easily = donates the H$^+$ most readily
		- Bond strength decreases as atomic size increases (Coulomb's Law: greater distance, weaker attraction)
	- Bond Polarity (High polarity = stronger acid)
		- Think: Electrons shared unevenly = act more like ion = H+ falls off easier

When hydrogen is bonded to X (H-X), when X's pull on the shared electrons to itself increases, the acidity of the molecule also increases.
- i.e. oxyacids. (H-O-X)

- The H of the HO is having its shared electron bond drawn away from the H and towards the O (since O has a stronger electronegativity)
	- The more the oxygen can pull the electrons, the weaker the bond strength is
		- The added electronegativities of the other elements in the compound helps the O further draw the electrons towards it (and away from the H+)
		- Think of tug of war: H is soloing one side while the rest of the things are helping O pull on the other side. 
- If comparing the amount of O's and how it relates to strength,
	- i.e. HClO$_4$ and HClO$_3$
	- Greater amount of O's = greater strength
	- The electronegativity of the additional O atoms helps the O of the HO bond pull the electrons towards itself and away from the H+, making the bond more polar and thus easier for the H+ to separate.
- If comparing two different molecules with same amount of O, but different X:
	- i.e. HClO and HIO
	- The more electronegative X is, the stronger the acid is.
	- Cl is more electronegative than I, so HClO > HIO
		- The Cl aids the O in drawing electrons to itself and away from the H, thereby weakening the bond and causing the H to be released more easily.
