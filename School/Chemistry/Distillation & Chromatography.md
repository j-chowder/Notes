- Methods used to components of a mixture.

##### Distillation
- based on the differences of boiling points.
- done when:
	- boiling stops: no more bubbles
	- condensation stops: no more drippage.

##### Chromatography
- based on the difference in the attraction of components for a mobile vs. stationary phase.
- Stationary = holds the sample to be separated.
- Mobile = moving substances that moves through stationary.
	- These are not the samples being analyzed. It is the solvent (used to separate the solvents)

- For paper chromatography:
	- stationary phase was the paper
	- Mobile phase was the solvent: water, ethanol.

- Polarity plays a huge role in chromatography
	- if solvent and sample have similar polarity, they will be more attracted to each other

- R$_f$ = distance traveled by sample/distance travel by solvent
