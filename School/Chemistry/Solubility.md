For equilibrium equations, solubility is the **change in concentration** (C in ICE)
- To put it simply, solubility is the amount of moles that reacted (of the salt)
	- This is just a new term because of the specific solution of dissolution. 

- Two (main) kinds of problems:
	- Given K(sp) and required to calculate **solubility**
		- Molar ratios to get the equilibrium concentrations of the products.
		- Will always be K(sp) = (x)
		
	- Given **solubility/concentrations** and required to calculate K(sp)
		- If given initial concentrations, then I.
		- If given solubility, then C.
		- If given Equilibrium concentrations, then E.
			- ([[ICE Tables]])
		
- For every Solubility problem, always write out the balanced equation (of the dissolution) and set up your Equilibrium Expression first.

### Common Ion Effect
- Substances can dissolve in solvents besides water. These solvents can share ions (common ions) with the solid that we dissolve.

- Those ions are thus calculated in their initial concentrations.
- If we think about it with [[Le Châtelier’s Principle]], concentration is added to the right side of the equation. Thus the equation has to shift left to "relieve stress."
- This ultimately **lowers** the Ksp value because the salt won't have to dissolve as much to reach equilibrium. 
	- This means that it also lowers the **solubility** of the salt, as less of the salt dissolved.

### Percent Dissociation
- The percentage of the initial substance that dissociates.
- "How much reacted compared to what it started with"

### Solubility Equilibria
- The common ion effect reduces the solubility of a salt, but what if we wanted to increase the solubility of a salt? 
	- We would basically do the opposite of what happens in the common ion effect.
	- We would **remove** ions so that the reaction shifts right so that more reactants react.

- reducing the pH (put in an acidic environment <7 pH) of a solution can often increase solubility.
- Acids (H$^+$) react with bases, so need to memorize that if the salt has the hydroxide ion, (OH$^-$) it will be more soluble in an acid.

- Otherwise, we can know from the phrasing of the question:
	- “SrF2 is a salt that is more soluble than an acid.”
		- This will imply that H+ ions are reacting with one of the ions (bases), this shifts the reaction to the right and makes the salt more soluble.
	- “When H$^+$ is added to this system, it reacts with a base. What happens to solubility?”
		- Increases because one of the ions gets removed from the equilibrium and thus the reaction shifts right.
