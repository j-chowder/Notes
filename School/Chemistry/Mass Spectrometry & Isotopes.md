Isotopes
- Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (so different mass)
	- number of protons are found via atomic number. Total mass - atomic # = # of neutrons.

Mass Spectrometry/Spectroscopy
- Graph that shows the ratio of different isotopes.
	- Used to calculate the average atomic mass

- Average atomic mass = (mass of isotope x)(% of x) + (mass of isotope y)(% of y)
