##### K is the equilibrium constant and is unitless. It is the ratio of the products divided by the reactants (at equilibrium molarity)

###### Characteristics of K 
- K expressions do not include **solids and liquids** 
	- because concentrations of pure solids and liquids do not change.

- K is a constant; it doesn't change with the addition of extra concentrations or added stuff because it is a **ratio of products/reactants.**

- However, the only factor that can affect K is **temperature** 
	- If the temperature **increases in an endothermic reaction, K will increase** because it favors the creation of products for that reaction.
		- Think heat is added to reactant, so need to shift to product.
	- If the temperature **increases in an exothermic reaction, K will decrease** because it favors the creation of reactants for that reaction. 
		- Think heat is added to product, so need to shift to reactant.

- To calculate K, it is a ratio of the concentration of products divided by the concentration of the reactants (whose coefficients become their powers)
- To calculate K$_P$, same ratio but of the pressures instead of concentration.

###### Hess's Law for K 

Similarly to [[Hess's Law]], we can know what happens to K when you tinker with the equation itself.

1. When you reverse the reaction, (reactants -> products, products -> reactants)
	- 1/K or K^-1.
	- Written qualitatively, The equilibrium expression for a reaction is the **reciprocal** for a reaction written in reverse. 
2. Multiply the coefficients of the reaction by n
	- K$^n$ 
	- If the coefficients are multiplied by some value n, the K is raised to the power of n.
3. Add chemical reactions together
	- K(total) = K$_1$ x K$_2$ x K$_n$ 
	- When adding equations, K values are multiplied together.

##### Significance of K

- K tells us about the tendency of a reaction to occur (which is dependent on the magnitude of K)
	- If K >> 1 (If 10$^3$ or larger)
		- Equilibrium lies far to the right, the reaction essentially “goes to completion” because your limiting reactant gets completely used up

	- If K << 1 (If 10^-3 or lower)
		- Equilibrium lies to the left. Not a lot of product forming. (So reaction does not occur that much)
	- 10$^3$ < K < 10^-3
		- need to calculate to see. Q > K, reaction has too much product and needs to shift left. Q < K, reaction has too much reactant and needs to shift right.

- K tells us whether a set of given concentrations represents equilibrium concentrations or not (K is the equlibrium constant: we compare that with [[Reaction Quotient, Q]])
	- To determine whether a reaction is at equilibrium, we need to calculate the reaction quotient, Q.

- K allows us to determine the equilibrium position given a set of initial concentrations.
