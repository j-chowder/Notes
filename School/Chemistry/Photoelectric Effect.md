States that electrons can be emitted from the surface of a metal when light strikes it.

1. No electrons are emitted below a specific **threshold frequency**, regardless of intensity
	1. Since frequency is inversely related to wavelength, light has a **maximum wavelength** that it needs to knock electrons off a metal.

1. More electrons are emitted as light intensity increases.
	1. intensity is the concentration or the amount of photons.

1. KE of the electrons emitted increases as the frequency of the light increases.
	1. excess energy goes into speeding the electrons up.
