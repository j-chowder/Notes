Arrhenius definition:
- Acids produce H+ when they dissolve; bases produce OH- when they dissolve
Bronsted-Lowry definition:
- Acids are proton donators (give away H+); bases are proton acceptors (receive the H+)

- Are electrolytes, (dissolve into ions that can conduct an electrical current)

Acid - Conjugate Base  (A - CB)
- Acids dissociate and form conjugate bases (which can react with H+ and turn back into the acid)
- The CB is basically the dookie left over when the acid gives away the H+

- <font size=2>Strong acids have weak conjugate bases because it completely dissociates -> it does not want to accept the H+ and turn back into the acid (because of large K, it does not reverse reaction)
	Weak acids have strong conjugate bases because it barely dissociates -> it wants to accept the H+ and turn back into the acid (because of small K, lots of reactants, wants to reverse reaction to remove products and turn back into reactants.)
	comparing this with water, in a strong acid dissolution, water accepts all of the H+ ions to form H3O+, so it is considered a "strong base" while the conjugate base does not accept the H+ ion (otherwise it would reform into the same acid) - (because it is a large K)

Base - Conjugate Acid (B - CA)
- Bases steal a H+ and turn into conjugate acids (which can lose that H+)
- The CA is basically the dookie when the base accepts the H+
