## A buffer is a solution whose purpose is to resist change of pH
- Still does fluctuate, but just to a small degree
- Composed of:
	- weak acids or bases containing a common ion
		- i.e. weak acid and its CB
		- i.e. weak base and its CA

- If you see "buffered solution" recognize that that means there's a common ion (in the form of the CB or CA) (see [[Solubility]])

pH does not change that much in a buffer because (in the case of an acid and CB):
- the added acid reacts completely with the already present base (CB) so the acid reacts with the base to reform into the original acid (that is weak)
- The composition of the solution therefore does not change because the addition of the acid is converted into something present already.

- I.e.
	- HCN/CN$^-$ 
		- Add OH$^-$ 
			- HCN + OH$^-$ -> H$_2$O + CN$^-$ 
		- Add H$^+$
			- CN$^-$ + H$^+$ -> HCN
	- ==A strong substance is added, but is then replaced by something **weak** AND that is **already present in the solution.**==
	- A buffer (which consists of a conjugate acid-base pair, can adapt to both addition of H$^+$ and OH$^-$ to react with it and form a weak and already present substance)

Steps to solve equilibrium problems w/ buffers
1. Look at major species (pay attention to solubility rules/ weak/strong)

2. See if anything will react with each other (acids w/ bases)

3. If do: do the reaction

4. Now find the biggest pH provider (biggest K)
	1. Might require kw = kakb, etc.
5. Then solve normally with ICE box w/ the reaction of the biggest K (might have common ion effect with conjugate in product)

## The pH in the buffer is determined by the ==ratio== of the concentration of the acid to the base

- ${H+} = Ka(Acid/CB)$ 

- As long as this ratio (of acid to base) remains virtually constant, the pH will remain virtually constant (since we can see that the ratio is the only thing that can change H+ and therefore pH)

- This will be the case as long as the concentrations of the buffering materials are large compared with amounts of H$^+$ or OH$^-$ added.

## Henderson Hasselbalch Equation
- pH = pKa + log{base/acid}
	- where pKa is the -log of the ka
	- Make sure that it is always ka
- This is used to:
	- Calculate for pH 
	- Calculate the concentrations needed for a specific pH (since Ka stays constant)
	- Identify a specific acid to generate a specific pH (using its Ka value)

## Buffer Capacity
- The amount of H$^+$ or OH$^-$ that a buffer can absorb without a significant change in pH
- Determined by the magnitudes of the acid and base. The **bigger the concentration of the weak acid and weak base** in our solution, the more H$^+$/OH$^-$ our buffer can absorb.

- Optimal buffering occurs when the concentration of acid = concentration of base
	- This also means that since the ratio is 1 and log(1) = 0, the pH has the same value as the pKa
	- We can use this concept to find an acid/base whose pKa value is the same as the pH value we need.
