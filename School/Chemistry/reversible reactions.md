- All phase changes are reversible 
	- ice cube can melt, then refreeze.

In a reversible chemical reaction,
- the left-to-right (reactant to product) reaction is the **forward reaction**
- the right-to-left (product to reactant) reaction is the **reverse reaction**

Examples of important reversible processes are:
- the loss and gain of protons (H+) in acid-base reactions
- the loss and gain of electrons (e-) in [[Redox reactions]]
