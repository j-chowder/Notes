- Basically a graph that illustrates the solid, liquid, and gas states as well as the transitions in between them.

	- The upward sloping ones show each phase as more heat energy is added and the temperature goes up.
	- The flat, horizontal lines represent the transition in between phases
		- Two different states of matter can coexist.
		- During transitions, the temperature won't go up (thus why it's horizontal) because the extra heat energy is focused on breaking the IMFs. Temperature will go up once the bonds are broken and the substances has changed states.

- Upper horizontal line (transition from liquid to gas) should be longer than the lower horizontal line (transition from solid to liquid).
	- This is because the transition from liquid to gas requires ALL of the IMFs to be broken, while the transition from solid to liquid only requires SOME of the IMFS to be broken. Thus, more energy is needed to turn liquid to gas than solid to liquid.

To calculate on sloped lines, use Q = sm$\triangle$T
- The temperature changes for the individual phases, if not explicitly stated are:
	- Solid: (melting point - initial)
	- Liquid: (boiling point - melting point)
	- Gas: (final - boiling point)


- However, for the horizontal lines, you have to use specific equations.
	- Q = (mol)H(vap)
		- HV is heat of vaporization which is given
	- Q = (mol)H(fus)
		- HF is heat of fusion which is given

- Then add everything up.

- I recommend drawing a rough sketch of the curve which the melting/boiling points labelled.
- Then mark on the curve where the the temperature of the reaction starts, and where it ends. Then you can see the individual lines that you need to calculate for.
	- heat of fusion/vap is usually in kJ/mol so make sure to have all units match.
