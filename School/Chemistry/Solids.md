#### Metals
- Metal atoms are not charged - not losing electrons
	- All atoms are able to share the valence electrons
	- Electrons are shared in non-directional bonds. (which is why they can conduct electricity)

#### Solids
- Lattice points: specific place in the lattice where you would fine a particle (ion, molecule, atom, etc.)
- divided into two categories: amorphous and crystalline

##### Molecular Solids
- Atoms within a molecule are held together with covalent/ polar covalent bonds
- Individual molecules are held together due to IMFs
	- Which lets them form solids/liquids

- When melted/vaporized, covalent and polar covalent bonds DO NOT BREAK
- IMFs are overcome, thus allowing the individual molecules to slide past each other OR escape and become a gas
