Crystalline solids
- Lattice -> 3d structure of a crystal. 
- Each lattice has a unit cell, which is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal.

| Electrical Conductivity | Trash as a solid; <br>Excellent conductors when molten,<br>aqueous, and gas. |
| Solubility in water     | Generally soluble.                                                           |
- Melting Point
	- High because the oppositely charged ions are strongly attracted to each other - a lot of energy is required to melt the solid.
- Boiling Point
	- High for the same reason
- Conductivity
	- Only high in states where it is mobile.
		- separated ions can move around and conduct electricity (mobile charges)
- Solubility
	- water molecules (polar), pull apart the ionic solid.
		- positive hydrogen from the water - negative ion
		- negative oxygen from the water - positive ion.

## Ion Size vs. Atom size
- If the ion is positively charged (cations), the radius decreases. 
	- Decrease in electrons -> decrease in repulsions -> smaller
- If the ion is negatively charged (anions), the radius increases.
	- increase in electrons -> increase in repulsions -> bigger.
- i.e.
	- Li$^+$ is smaller than Li
	- F$^-$ is bigger than F.
