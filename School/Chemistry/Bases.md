### Dissociation of Strong Bases 
- Groups 1 and 2 + hydroxide bases are strong, i.e. LiOH
	- Group 1 format: MOH -> M$^+$ + OH$^-$ 
	- Group 2 format: M(OH)$_2$ -> M$^2$$^+$ + 2OH$^-$ 

- Calc. pH for 0.75 M Ba(OH)$_2$ (Strong so completely dissolves)
	- 14.18
	- Calculation does not require K$_b$ because it dissolves completely.

## Weak bases
- Ammonia derivatives
	- Tips:
		- If K$_b$, we know that it is a base; thus we know now that the H's of the ammonia derivatives are not indicators of an acid.
		- NH$_3$ - 1, 2, or all 3 H$^+$ replaced with a hydrocarbon group.
			- Look for N, Cs, and Hs.
	- Since bases are proton acceptors, NH$_3$ and its derivatives will accept the H$^+$ from 
	  H$_2$O, and OH$^-$ will also be from water. 
	  - The H$^+$ always attaches to the N.
	- i.e. CH$_3$NH$_2$ + H$_2$O <-> CH$_3$NH$_3$$^+$ + OH$^+$ 


### Solving for pH from basic solutions
- Same thing as [[Acids and Bases]], just one extra step:
	- Once the {OH$^-$} is calculated, turn to {H$^+$} with kw strat, or turn to pOH and turn into pH.
