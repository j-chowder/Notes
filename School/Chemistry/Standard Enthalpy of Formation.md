### The change in enthalpy that accompanies the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements with all substances in their standard states. ($\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$) 

- ##### For an element, standard state is at 1 atm and 25$\degree$ C (room temp)

---
- Some elemenst are diatomic as their standard state:
	- H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I (Think: 7. They form a "7" shape on the periodic table)
- Liquid:
	- Hg, **Br**
- Gas:
	- Noble gases, H, N, O, **F, Cl**
- Solid:
	- Everything else.
- ##### Note: When an element is in its standard state, its heat of formation is 0 because that is its natural state.

#####   $\triangle$H$_r$$_x$$_n$$\degree$ = $\Sigma$ (product $\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$) - ($\Sigma$ reactant $\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$)

- "Sum of $\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$ of products times their coefficients - sum of $\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$  of reactants times their coefficients"

- Basically find each $\triangle$H$_f$$\degree$ for each substance (from table)
- multiply the number by the substance's coeffecient in the reaction
- add up all of numbers on the product and on the reactant side
- subtract the product from the reactant
