- Substances that speed up reactions without being consumed.

Lower activation energies via:
- Stabilizing the transition states of a mechanism
	- which basically makes the transition state a lower energy state
		- which basically means lowering the activation energy so making the hill shorter on a [[Potential Energy Diagram]]
- Enabling a different mechanism with a lower activation energy/different intermediates. 

Types:
- Homogenous catalyst
	- Present in the same phase as the reacting molecules
- Heterogeneous catalyst
	- Present in a different phase than the reacting molecules

---
- Enzymes
	- Digestion and many other processes in the body
- Acid-base catalysts
	- Can be an acid, base, or both
	- Hydrolysis of sugar into glucose and fructose in H$_2$SO$_4$ 
- Surface catalysts
	- always a solid, but solids are not always a surface catalyst.
	- Usually metal surfaces
---
Catalysts can:
- Bind to reactants
	- attracted to the reactants, held by IMF
	- Enzymes
- Involve covalent bonding between catalysts and reactant(s)
- Or do both

Catalyst vs. Intermediate
- Catalyst is used up -> reformed
- Intermediate is formed -> used up

- To identify, cancel out and then see from there. Overall reactions can **not contain intermediates/catalysts.**
