For some time, t, when the system is not at equilibrium, the reaction quotient, Q takes the place of [[Equilibrium Constant, K]] in the law of mass action.

--- 

The difference between Q and K is that 
-  To calculate K you put in the equilibrium concentrations (which is given)
- To calculate Q, you put in the concentrations at that moment (which is given)
	- Or you need to do molar ratios to calculate if they are not explicitly given.
	- Same formula, but use initial concentration.

Significance of Q

- If Q = K
	- the system is at equilibrium.
		- Because you can only get the equilibrium constant, K, with molarities at equilibrium.
- If Q > K
	- That means that Q has more products that what is needed for equilibrium. Inversely, that means that it has too little reactants. So it needs to reduce the amount of products it has and increase the amount of reactants it has

	- Shift left to make the ratio smaller (Consuming products and forming reactions until equilibrium is achieved.)
- If Q < K
	- Then too much reactant and too little product in Q’s situation.
	- System shifts to the right
	- consuming reactants and forming products until equilibrium is achieved. 

*Think of  “shifting left and right” as “emphasizing reactant and product”
Shifting left means that it needs to emphasize the creation of reactants.*
