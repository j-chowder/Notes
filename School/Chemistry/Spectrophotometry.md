- Works because colored substances absorb and reflect light
- As you increase the concentration of a solution, you increase the number of molecules available to absorb/reflect light, so absorbance increases.


### Beer's Law
- Used to calculate the concentration of a substance after measuring its absorbance

- For a specific substance, there are better wavelengths of light that are absorbed better.
	- Absorbance spectrum shows the absorbance ef a substance at different wavelengths
	- Highest peak on the graph is the "best" wavelength.
