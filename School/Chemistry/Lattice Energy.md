- Energy released when a solid crystal forms from separate ions in the gas state.
	- Always involve single gases turning into an ionic solid.
	- are always exothermic.
	- make extremely stable bonds -> which gives ionic compounds their stability.
	- bigger lattice energy, bigger attraction.

- The force of attraction and energy between oppositely charged particles is:
	- directly proportional to the size of their charges
	- inversely proportional to the distance between them.
		- ([[Coulomb's Law]])

- Larger ions = nucleus of cation is farther away from the nucleus of anion.
	- farther away, according to Coulomb's Law, means less attraction
	- larger ion = weaker attraction.
	- weaker attraction = smaller lattice energy. 
	- Refer to atomic radius trend ([[Periodic Trends]])

- Larger charge = ions are more strongly attracted
	- larger charge = stronger attraction
	- stronger attraction = larger lattice energy

- Ion charge is more important than distance.
