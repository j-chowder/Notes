- Relates the force between two single charges separated by a distance.

1. As two charges move closer together, the force between them gets stronger.
	- Closer distance = greater attraction
2. Stronger charges, stronger the force between.
	- Bigger the charge, bigger attraction. 
		- i.e. +3 & -3 > +1 & -1

- Also describes the froces that exist within the atom that affects how the electrons are bound to the nucleus

	- Forces of attractions exist between negatively charged electrons and positively charged nucleus.
		- Opposites attract
	- Forces of repulsion between electrons exist
		- Alike repels
