Galvanic/Electrolytic cells that are not in standard state.
- Remember that Standard Cells are with the conditions of 1 M, 25 C, 1 atm.

Concentration Cells
- Anode and cathode are based on the same half reaction, but the **concentrations** of the ions are different.
	- In the case of a standard cell, however, in which the concentrations are the same (1 M), E° = 0 because it is the same half reactions.
- As the reaction happens, it will happen so that the concentrations of the anode and cathode equal out (since reactions go towards equilibrium).
	- So one will increase, while the other decreases.
- Since the reaction is happening with the goal of both half reactions having the same concentration, e$^-$ is being transferred in an unbalanced way - so electricity is being created - so E° ≠ 0.

Thus, we can conclude that **Standard Cells and Non-standard cells have different voltages (E)**

- Since voltage (E) is a measure of the ability of the cell to do work towards the ultimate goal of reaching equilibrium,
	- The **farther** you are from equilibrium, the **more work** you need (so can do) to get to equilibrium. 
	- So bigger E = more work can be done = farther from equilibrium

- Why?
	- Since standard cells are in standard conditions (1 M), then Q = 1.
		- So, if Q (non-standard) < 1 = farther from equilibrium (than Q standard) = more work required = bigger E.
			- E > E°
		- Likewise, if Q (non-standard) > 1 = closer to equilibrium (than Q standard) = less work = smaller E.
			- E < E°

- When given a concentration cell:
	- Compare the new concentrations of the solutions.
	- The solutions correspond to the [[Reaction Quotient, Q]] equation.
	- If there is less of the product solution/ion, OR there is more of the react, then Q < 1.
	- If there is more product solution/ion OR there is less of the react, then Q > 1.
