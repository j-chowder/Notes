#### Effective Nuclear Charge (Zeff)
- the net attraction that an electron experiences towards the nucleus
- affected by
	1. the number of protons in the nucleus (greater attractions towards the positively charged nucleus)
		- Coulomb's law states that opposites attract.
	1. the amount of effectiveness of repulsions from other electrons.
		- Coulomb's law states that like repels. 
		- Coulomb's law states that further distance = weaker attraction.

##### Electrons in different principle energy levels provide very effective, somewhat effective, or ineffective repulsions.

- Electrons closer to the nucleus (in a lower principal energy level) than a given electron provide effective (not more) repulsions for the given electron
	- Think: Is between the nucleus and the target electron so pushes it away from the nucleus.

- Electrons farther from the nucleus (in a higher principal energy level) provide very ineffective (not less) repulsions
	- Think: further from the nucleus than the target electron so pushes it closer.

- Electrons in the same energy level provide somewhat effective repulsions.
	- Think: same energy level so can either push closer or farther from the nucleus. (RNG)


For a given electron, the more electrons in lower principal energy levels there are, the more effective repulsions that the given electron experiences. This leads to a weaker effective nuclear charge (Smaller Zeff), and the given electron is less attracted to the nucleus.

#### Shielding
- Each electron in a polyelectronic atom experiences both the attraction of the nucleus and the repulsion of other electrons in the atom (which is just Zeff)
	- These other electrons “shield” the electron from the full attraction of the nucleus
