#### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
- Can not determine position and speed of the electron at the same time.
	- Can only know one at the same time: if we know speed, can not know position, etc.
- Trying to change either will change the other

##### Bohr Model: Problems
- Violates Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
- If electrons were in orbits, energy and position could be measured at the same time
- Did not agree with the math for electron energies of elements other than H

##### Schrodinger's Model
- Theorized electrons had wave properties
	- electrons were standing wave surrounding nucleus
- model matched the math for electron energies
- Orbital shapes were discovered bc of this.
