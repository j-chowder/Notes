### Ionic
- Complete transfer of electrons

- Between metal and nonmetal
	- metals transfer electrons to nonmetals
		- metals becomes cations; nonmetals become anions.

- Attractions between the oppositely charge particles cause the ions to bond.
- [[Coulomb's Law]] applies
---
### Covalent
- Equal sharing of electrons

- Between identical atoms
	- can be between nonmetals or metals

- Metallic bonds are covalent bonds between metals
	- Lots of metal atoms collectively share electrons.
###### Metallic Bonds
- Consist of closely packed cations floating in a "sea of electrons"
- All the atoms are able to share the electrons
	- Electrons are not bound to individual atoms - they are "**delocalized**."
		- These delocalized electron covalent bonds are "**nondirectional"**
- strong nondirectional bonds = metal cations can slide past each other without breaking their bonds.
	- explains why malleable and ductile.

### Polar Covalent
- Unequal sharing of electrons
- Between nonidentical nonmetal atoms
- One atom pulls on the electrons more forcefully than the other
- Atoms have partial charges (slighty positive/slightly negative)
- Determined by electronegativity
	-  [[Electronegativity]]
- Can be said to have "ionic character"
