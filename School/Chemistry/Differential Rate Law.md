#### Expresses the relationship between concentrations of reactants and the rate of the reaction.

## Rate = k{A}$^x${B}$^y$  
- K is rate constant
	-  is constant at constant temperature; when temperature changes, k changes.
- A and B are chemical formulas
- x and y are the orders of each reactant.


### Orders
- How concentration and reaction rate are related.

- Zero Order
	- Rate is not affected by {A}
- First Order
	- Both rate and {A} will increase and decrease by the same ratio.
		- If concentration triples, rate triples.
- Second Order
	- Rate is directly proportional to the square of {A}
		- If concentration doubles, rate quadruples
		- If concentration triples, rate increases by a rate of 9.
- Third Order
	- Rate is directly proportional to the cube root of {A}
- Negative Order
	- Rate is inversely proportional to {A}$^x$ 
		- When {A} doubles, rate is halved.

- Orders for the whole reaction is just adding y + x. i.e. 2 + 3 = 5th order.

- Orders can only be determined from experimental data.

## How to solve
1. Identify 2 trials in which the concentration of {A} are the same.
2. Set up an equation so that { RATE OF TRIAL 2}/{RATE OF TRIAL 1} = {RATE LAW 2}/{RATE LAW 1}
	- You will be able to solve for one of the variables by simplifying.
3. Rinse and repeat for the order of {B}.
---
4. Calculate for K after finding the values of the individual orders.
5. Plug in values from a trial and solve for K. 
	- Be wary of units -> the exponent will also change the units so be wary of that.

----
If one reactant's concentration is not held constant:
1. Solve for its order first.
2. Then once you have the order you can just solve for the other reactant.
3. Same thing; just slightly more math.
