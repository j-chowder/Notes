Acid/Base indicator:
- changes color based on the pH of the solution.

Endpoints:
- the pH at which an indicator changes color.


- Endpoints are characteristic of the indicator 
- equivalence point is the characteristic of the chemical reaction.

Indicators are weak acids (HIn)
- HIn -> H$^+$ + In$^-$ 
	- Colors come from the fact that the acid itself is a different color from its CB (HIn and In- are different colors)
	- The color that is seen depends on which species is dominant (mainly have)
- When put in a solution with a strong acid,
	- Reaction will shift left (because more H$^+$ is added to the product)
	- Forms a lot of HIn with very little In- (which makes the solution the color of the HIn)
- When put in a solution with a strong base
	- Reaction will shift right (OH- reacts with H+ and gets removed from the equation)
	- Forms a lot of In- . Very little HIn (which makes the solution the color of the In-)
- relatively equal amounts of each = a mix of the two colors

When does the indicator change color? (Where are the endpoints?)
- pH = pKa Â± 1
	- where Ka is for the indicator.
	- The greater one is the color of the In$^-$
		- Think: the more basic one (closer to 14) is the color of the CB
	- The smaller one is the color of the HIn
		- Think: the more acidic one (closer to 0) is the color of the acid.

Notes:
- Phenyl ethylene: 
	- Clear -> pink (when more basic)
- Two sets of color changes when it is diprotic.
- Pick an indicator that is near the equivalence point.
