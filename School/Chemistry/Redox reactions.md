*Stands for Oxidation-Reduction reactions

To remember which is which, think of the acronym **OIL RIG**
- **O**xidation **i**s the **l**oss of electrons
- **R**eduction **i**s the **r**eduction of electrons

Types of Redox reactions:
- Combustion
	- Burning of hydrocarbons (H and C); sometimes oxygen (O)
	- Side products: Water (H2O) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
- Synthesis
	- Elements to form one compound
	- Think: Many small -> one big
- Decomposition
	- One compound, decomposes into its elements
	- Think: One big -> many small.

Rules for Assigning Oxidation States (to balance)
- Oxidation state of an uncombine element is zero
	- i.e. O$_2$ or Na
- The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
- Group 1 elements are +1
- Group 2 elements are +2
- Hydrogen is usually +1, 
	- but -1 in hydrides
- Fluorine is -1
- Oxygen is often -2
	- Other values when bonded to fluorine
	- is -1 in hydrogen peroxide (H$_2$O$_2$)
- Chlorine is -1
	- other values when bonded to fluorine or oxygen

Balancing Redox reactions by half-reactions
1. To get the half-reactions, find the atoms that either oxidize or reduce from reactant to product.
2. Balance the atoms apart from oxygen and hydrogen
3. Balance the oxygens by adding water molecules (H$_2$O)
4. Balance the hydrogens by adding hydrogen ions (H$^+$)
5. Balance the charges by adding electrons
6. Balance the amount of electrons so that they are the same in both half-reactions by multiplying by coefficients
7. Combine and cancel
---
8. For a base, now add OH$^-$ to both sides of the equation to cancel out any spare lone H$^+$
	a. Combine the H$^+$ with the OH$^-$ to make H$_2$O.
9. Final equation will have no H$^+$ and sometimes OH$^-$
