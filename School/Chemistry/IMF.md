### Intermolecular Forces

- Difference between Intramolecular forces and IMF

| IMF                                                           | Intra                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Forces between/outside a molecule                             | Forces within a molecule                      |
| London Dispersion Forces (LDF)                                | Covalent bonds                                |
| Dipole-Dipole Attraction (DDA)                                | Polar covalent bonds                          |
| Hydrogen Bonding (HB)                                         | Ionic bonds                                   |
| IMFs attract molecules together to form<br>solids and liquids | IntraMFs hold atoms together<br>to form bonds |

### London Dispersion Forces (LDF)

- LDF exists in ALL molecules; ONLY IMF in nonpolar molecules.
- Happens because of instantaneous dipole moments
	- Since electrons are always moving, sometimes one side of the molecule is more polar than the other
- The strength of the LDF increases the more electrons that a molecule has
- More electrons = more polarizable = stronger instantaneous dipole moments.
#### Dipole-Dipole Attraction (DDA)

- DDA occurs between polar molecules.
	- Polar molecules have dipole moments; they have partially positive and negative areas.
- DDA can occur between identical molecules and between nonidentical molecules (just needs to be between polar molecules)

### Hydrogen Bonding (HB)

- HB is a strong type of DDA
- HB happens only between molecules that have a H-N, H-O, or H-F bond
	- The H (that is connected to N, O, or F) bonds with a separate O, N, F.
- Molecules that can't hydrogen bond with itself can still hydrogen bond with molecules that are able to hydrogen bond with themselves.

Generally LDF < DDA < HB. Exceptions depend on the size of the molecule.
