Process of adding a titrant to an analyte until the analyte has been completely neutralized.
- Basically until the acid/base have completely reacted with each other in equal amounts.

- Titrant
	- Solution of known concentration
	- Used to find the concentration of the analyte
	- Is the solution in the burette (is added to the analyte until it reaches the equivalence point)
- Analyte
	- Solution of unknown concentration
- Equivalence Point
	- Point where both substances have reacted completely with each other
		- When there is no more acid and base in the solution
