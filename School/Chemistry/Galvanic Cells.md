Also known as batteries

- Purpose: Use chemical energy -> electrical energy (electricity)
	- Spontaneous redox-reactions provides chemical energy therefore electricity.
- Oxidation occurs at the anode.
	- anode contains ALL chemicals involved in the oxidation half-reaction.
		- So Fe2+ AND Fe3+ (both reactants and products), H$^+$ 
	- Remember: An Ox 
	- Turns negative - so need salt bridge/porous disk to provide it with positive ions.
- Reductions occur at the cathode
	- Cathode contains ALL chemicals involved in the reduction half-reaction
		- MnO4 AND Mn2+ (both reactants and products), H$^+$
	- Remember with "Red Cat" (Reduction Cathode)
	- Turns positive - so need salt bridge/porous disk to provide it with negative ions.
- Electrodes
	- increase the reaction surface area
	- Role is to take in the electrons from the reaction.
	- Made out of metal:
		- Look to see if there is a **solid** metal in the half reaction.
			- If there is, use this as the metal for its specific electrode 
				- Note that anodes and cathodes can have their own different electrodes.
		- Otherwise, use Platinum (because it is inert while still conductive)
	- The mass of the electrode decreases in the anode; the mass of the electrode increases in the cathode.
		- In the anode, oxidation is happening which is turning metal into ions. The mass (from the electrode) -> into the solution as its ions
		- In the cathode, reduction is happening which is turning the ions into the metal.
- Salt Bridge/Porous Disk
	- To ensure that the anode and cathode stay electrically-neutral.


The concepts:
- Due to colliding between each other in order to react, the electrons just transfer from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent.
	- We have to separate the agents and use the wires as the only medium in which electrons can travel through.
- But after electrons go to the other side, it becomes negatively-charged and electrons do not want to go to that side anymore. (Opposites repel)
	- Likewise, the side that is providing the electrons will become positively-charged.
- So have to make each container electrically-neutral so that electrons can continually flow.
	- Salt bridge
		- tube filled with salt paste (enough water so it can conduct electricity)
			- So once one side becomes negatively-charged, the positively-charged ions from the salt bridge will neutralize it.
			- Likewise, the negatively-charged ions will go to the positively-charged side to neutralize it.
	- Porous disk
		- Microscopic holes big enough for ions to fit through.
			- Spectator ions in the compartments can flow to each side to neutralize.
