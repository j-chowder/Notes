- Formed using strong, directional covalent bonds between either carbon, silicon, or silicon with oxygen.


- Because of their strong covalent bonds, network solids have a high melting point, are brittle, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity.

	- High melting point occurs because a lot of energy must be applied to break the strong covalent bonds
	- Network solids are brittle because the strong directional covalent bonds make the solid rigid and inflexible, so the solid will break rather than bend when force is applied to it.
	- The poor conductivity results from a lack of mobile particles in the solid. Electrons are trapped between two specific atoms in a covalent bond, so they canâ€™t act as mobile charges.
		- Because the covalent bonds are directional

### Diamond

- Structure: one huge covalently bonded molecule
	- each carbon atom is sp$^3$ hybridized and is bonded tetrahedrally to 4 other carbon atoms
	- The carbon atoms are 3D bonded with strong, directional covalent bonds.
- Thus, diamond is very hard and rigid due to having strong covalent bonds three-dimensionally


### Graphite

- Structure: planes of carbon rings weakly bonded together
	- Each carbon atom is sp$^2$ hybridized and is bonded in a trigonal planar arrangement to 3 other carbon atoms
	- The carbons are two-dimensionally bonded and form planes of bonded atoms
		- These planes are weakly bonded to each other.
- Thus, graphite is soft because it is bonded two-dimensionally and because its structure of planes of carbon atoms are loosely bonded to each other.
	- This lets carbon slide past each other easily.

- So, to compare diamond vs. graphite, we would talk about their structure and bonding.
	- "Diamond is stronger than graphite because the carbon atoms of diamonds are 3D bonded with strong, directional covalent bonds in one large molecule. Graphite, on the other hand, is 2D bonded with weak covalent bonds between planes of carbon rings."
