#### Marbury v. Madison (1803)

establishing the concept of judicial review, which allows the Supreme Court to invalidate laws and government actions that conflict with the Constitution.

**Background / Facts**

* Conflict between Federalists and Democratic Republicans.
* John Adams (Federalist) lost election of 1800 to Jefferson (DR) --> Adams wanted to weaken their power so he packed the courts with Federalist judges.
* Marbury is one of those judges. But all the procedures (called commissions) didn't go through by Adams leaving presidency. 
* So Marbury sued Madison, (who was Secretary, in charge of approving the commission) and asked the Court for a 'writ of mandamus'.

**Constitutional Principle**

* Article 3 of Constitution (Judicial Branch).
	* Establishes proper jurisdiction for the Supreme Court (basically what they can and cannot do).
* What is important is that there was a Judiciary Act that expanded the Court's power -- under the Judiciary Act, the court was legally able to provide a writ of mandamus to support Marbury.
* But, Marshall instead declared the Judiciary Act unconstitutional -- as it conflicted with the Constitution, which is the supreme law.

**Outcome:**

Marshall declaring the Judiciary Law unconstitutional resulted in establishing a precedent of judicial review - the Supreme Court became the final interpreter of the Constitution.

When an act of Congress is in conflict with the Constitution, Marshall wrote, the Court must uphold the Constitution as supreme.

#### McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

reinforced the powers of the federal government. It revolved around whether the state of Maryland had the authority to tax the Second Bank of the United States, leading to broader questions about the power of federal institutions and states' rights.

**Background / Facts**

* Congress chartered 2nd Bank of the United States (federal bank). It had branches in different states.
* Maryland no like having one in their state. State legislature passed law that stated any bank not chartered by Maryland will be taxed (a lot).
* McCulloch was the cashier of the specific branch --> no pay.

**Constitutional Principle**

* Maryland argued that the establishment of a national bank was unconstitutional.
	* Article 1 Section 8 did not say Congress had power to create a bank
* But McCulloch's lawyers argued that the bank was constitutional.
	* Article 1 Section 8 contained necessary and proper clause.

**Outcome**:

the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that Congress had **implied powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution**, and states could not interfere with federal institutions, epitomized by the phrase "the power to tax involves the power to destroy."

Established supremacy of national laws over state laws. Whenever a state law is in conflict with a federal law, federal law wins.

#### United States v Lopez

federalism and the balance of federal and state power

**Background / Facts**

* high school senior -- Lopez -- brought gun to school.
* Federal law: Gun Free School Zones Act of 1930 --> prohibited guns on school property.
* So Lopez was found guilty for breaking this federal law.

**Constitutional Principle:**

* Enumerated powers of Congress; Reserved powers of States.
	* Congress has no authority to pass legislation on guns.
	* Gun legislation is a state-issue 

 * The Gun Free School Zones Act was passed via the authority granted to Congress by the **commerce clause**.
	 * regulate commerce with foreign nations, Indian tribes, and interstate.

**Outcome**:

* Supreme Court had to render unconstitutional -- because if they did accept this law as fair game due to the commerce clause, then Congress would practically have zero regulations.

* Court ruling in state power. Keeping the federal power in check.
