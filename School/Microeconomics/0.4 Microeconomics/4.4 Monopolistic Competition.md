Monopolistic competition is an imperfect market structure where many, various sized firms compete for market demand shares. Monopolistic competition is the midpoint between monopolies and perfect competition. Hence, it shares characteristics from both market systems.

| System                           | # of Firms          | Barriers to Entry | Price Control                     | Products                | Efficiency                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Perfect Competition              | **very high**       | **very low**      | price takers -- zero control      | identical               | allocative and<br>productive |
| Monopolistic Competition         | **high**            | low               | **price makers -- has control**   | **differentiated**      | **inefficient**              |
| Monopolies<br>(no price discrim) | singular (very low) | very high         | **price makers -- total control** | **very differentiated** | **inefficient**              |

**Monopolistic competition graphs look identical to monopoly graphs** -- however, they are similar to perfectly competitive graphs in that they both have **short runs and long runs** (monopolies do not have that)

> Think restaurants, food courts, food trucks. It's (relatively) easy to enter the market and there are a lot of firms available. However, each restaurant sells their own differentiated food. Only that restaurant will sell that EXACT SPECIFIC item.

> Two examples: 
>    1. 
> 	   McDonald's and Carl's Jr both sell burgers, but only McDonald's sells the Big Mac. Only Carl's Jr sells the Western Bacon. Both sell fries, but McDonald's sells their signature distinct fries and Carl's Jr has their waffle fries. McDonalds got their apple pie; Carl's Jr got their Jalapeno Poppers.
>    2. 
> 	   Porn. Each "star" is assumed to be an individual "firm" in the business. There is a variety of content, there is a low barrier to entry, and there is product differentiation: different kinds of content to appeal to different fetishes. It's a no-brainer!

#### How do firms differentiate/win customers

1. By Style or Type
	* i.e. different foods in a food court
2. By Location
	* first mfing thing you lay your eyes on --> more likely to buy.
	* Imagine a restaurant in the ghetto part of town... would you rather go to a Popeyes there and risk your car window getting clapped, or go to a Chick-fil-A in the chill part of town?
3. By Quality
	* different types of chocolate
4. By Advertising
5. By Brand Names
	* i.e. you are selling ear swabs (brand name equivalent is Q-Tip). Connect your product to something that is 'popular' (or more well-known) to catch people's attention.
		* More people will know what a Q-Tip is versus what an ear swab is.

#### Short-Run

Analyzing the graph of a monopolistic competition firm is the same as how you would analyze a (uniform-price) monopoly graph. I ain't writing no mo' shiz.... Just Kidding! Har har har! (Trevor Noah please save us)

#### Long-Run

monopolistic competition shares the same long-run concept as a perfectly competitive market. Firms join or exit depending on the short-term profits (or losses) of firms already in the market:

`Firms are earning a (short-term) profit:`
* More firms will join 
* New firms mean more close substitutes and less market shares for each existing firm.
* Demand for each firm falls. 

`Firms are earning a (short-term) loss:`
* Firms exit. 
* Less firms mean less substitutes and more market shares for remaining firms.
* Demand for each firm rises.

And again, firms will keep entering and exiting the market until normal profit is achieved:
* Where ATC = P 
	* (which will be directly above where MR = MC)


Something to keep in mind is that the lower the barrier of entry to a market is, the faster the market will reach long-term equilibrium. These questions will very likely consist of comparing two different markets.
* Lower barrier of entry = firms can enter and exit easier and faster.

#### Efficiency and Excess Capacity

Recall:

**Productively Efficient:**
* At the minimum of the ATC curve.
* the point where a firm produces the maximum output with the minimum possible cost per unit
	* This also means that 
		* To the left of the minimum --> you are in economies of scale
		* To the right of the minimum --> you are in diseconomies of scale

(Example solving for profit at a PE point for a monopolistic competition graph)

**Excess Capacity**
* The firm can produce at a lower cost but holds back production to maximize profits.
* The firm is producing less than ( so to the left of) the PE point.

* Excess capacity is the difference between a firm's current inefficient level of production and the productively efficient level of output.
