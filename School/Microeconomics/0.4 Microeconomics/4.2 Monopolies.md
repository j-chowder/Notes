Monopolistic market systems have the characteristics of:
* One large firm
* Unique product
* High (or impossible) barriers to entry
* Price Makers -- total control over the price.

#### Demand Curve

*Because the monopolist is the market’s only supplier, the market graph and the individual firm graph are identical. So, the demand curve the monopolist has = the market demand curve.*

**Total Revenue Test** ([[2.4 Elasticity Applications]])

The demand curve on a monopoly graph has both elastic, inelastic, and unit elastic sections. 

Remember that:

* If price falls and TR increases then demand is **elastic**. 
* If price falls and TR falls then demand is **inelastic**.

Naturally, monopolists will only supply at a price and quantity where TR increases.
* Therefore a monopoly will never willingly produce in the inelastic range.

==The point where MR = 0 is:

1. The unit elastic point
2. Where TR is maximized
	* To clarify, where TR is maximized ≠ profit-maximizing point. TR is maximized when MR is 0 (MR is the derivative of TR). 
3. What separates the elastic and inelastic region of the demand curve.
	* section above = elastic region
	* section below = inelastic region.

**Determining elasticity:**
* elastic where MR > 0
* unit elastic where MR = 0
* inelastic where MR < 0

* If the question refers to a price and the elasticity of demand at that price, **go the demand line first, then go down to the MR.** Then if MR > 0 at that quantity, then it is elastic, etc. etc.

#### Analyzing curves

It's important to note that in monopolistic markets,

**the cost curves are the same (as every other market). The shutdown rule still applies. And the profit-maximizing rule still applies.**

The difference between monopoly and all other markets is that:

though MR = MC still applies, the monopolist’s profit-maximizing **price** is found by going up from the profit-maximizing quantity (where MR =MC) to where it meets the DEMAND CURVE.
* That is the price that consumers are willing to pay for said quantity -- if the monopoly wants money, they will naturally sell at that higher price.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc3oD5FEOBagiH6MxiKc0TiRBeogU2Ta0nxJwAxLSaRrxVcRHC9_vfAuKcT0GNA04Hn6XDwzpw9PwXutsU6HIb8YIP36Wz2hWT7JwNFupQCIe4Usk4BkxgciyM6ZNV-36D-mSvbPw?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

To reiterate, the profit-maximizing quantity is found via MR = MC. Then you determine TR and TC via the curve's price at that quantity.

#### Market Efficiency and Surplus

Consumer and Producer Surplus is very similar to when we did it in [[2.6 Surplus]].

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeCSrWj3D8zQQ86nsG2Jv2kv1PtEC5h5TKpP3M5Kge-dCX9pM1KSqi9fpvGhV5jGZzoTZqmUf1AgRnMYejwMAbY1lHZbyDel-xn4-lsKXAxcTXmacr9BNcPZ2K4f_juw6JTknYn?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

Note the empty triangle in the monopoly graph: there will always be deadweight loss -- as the monopolist will always benefit over the consumer.

* Why? Because society wants the monopolist to produce at where MC = D, but they produce at where MC = MR.

* To find DWL 
	* determine profit-maximizing quantity. DWL will always be to the RIGHT of this quantity.
	* Determine the intersection of D and MC.
	* DWL is enclosed by the demand line, the profit-maximizing quantity, and the MC line.

Therefore:

A monopoly deliberately **underproduces** and **overcharges** in a market -- they have the privilege to do so as they are the only firm that makes the market. They are the market. Hence, deadweight loss will be present.

#### Extra shiz that Selders added 

**Socially Optimal Point**

* where the market is allocatively efficient
* Where P (aka demand) = MC
* This point requires regulation from the government in order to produce here.

**Fair return point**

* Normal profit: TR = TC
* Where P = ATC

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdPEXbxE_iVoWMtgBYCbO_cQcwzMiVI4XdJXNzIRPnFZa1miLMjSDopnV7a_bCwLH-QGbqBGHwJQaI6TVZUw6h1HNqq9gnEgVP7E2Up81DhJcZi-l27-rs3iHtHOMhg2SoVLhbfCA?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

**Taxes & Subsidies**

* Adding a per-unit tax causes the MC to increase at all quantities (thereby increasing ATC as well). 
	* positive vertical translation of x amount of tax per unit.
* As a result, there will be new profit-maximizing quantities, prices, surplus, and DWL.
	* Q ↓, P ↑, DWL ↑.

* Lump-sum taxes are one-time taxes on the firm.
	* Since it is a one-time thing, lump-sum taxes are not reflected on graphs. 
	* Only ATC ↑. MC is not affected.
	* Since MC is not affected, quantities, prices, surplus, and DWL do not change.

* Subsidies are the opposite of taxes. Remember that subsidies are government-paid incentives -- the firm is getting paid money to sell their goods.
* So, adding a subsidy causes the MC to decrease at all quantities.
	* negative vertical translation of x amount of subsidy per unit.
* Again, there will be new profit-maximizing quantities, prices, surplus, and DWL.
	* Q ↑, P ↓, DWL ↓.

* Lump-sum subsidies are one-time subsidies on the firm.
	* Not reflected on graphs.
	* Only ATC ↓. MC is not affected.
	* Q, P, surplus, DWL do not change.

#### Natural Monopolies

*A natural monopoly occurs when a single firm can supply the entire market's demand for a product or service at a lower cost than multiple competing firms.*
* This happens when the fixed costs of production are extremely high, making it inefficient for more than one provider to operate.
* i.e. utilities like water, electricity, and natural gas, where infrastructure costs limit competition.

**A natural monopoly experiences economies of scale due to a large fixed cost**

* Greater fixed costs (initial investments into infrastructure) --> can spread those costs over a  **large output*** --> very low average costs per unit --> hence economies of scale


==**The difference between natural and normal monopoly is MC and ATC.**==
* natural monopoly = **ATC continually going down.**
	* The socially optimal price is often LOWER than the fair-return price.
	* Which assumes that either MC is constant or decreasing. 
		* if constant, ATC will continue going down -- ATC = AVC + AFC. If MC is constant and FC is constant, then ATC will decrease as Q increases.
		* if decreasing, should be common sense that ATC goes down.

**Dealing with a natural monopoly**

* Natural monopolies, unlike normal monopolies, are favored by society. Compared to private, small businesses, these large singular giants are able to produce lots at a much lower margin --> they have the potential to supply their product at a much lower price, benefiting the consumer.

* Usually owned by the government (public ownership) 
	* the government will put price regulations -  enforces price floors and ceilings to ensure reasonable prices.
	* owned by the government because it helps to offset the costs from those regulations.

* Again, regulation ensures that
	* the monopoly produces at the fair-return point.
		* more people are getting the product (supplying at a greater quantity)
		* it is at a lower, more reasonable price.
	* limits the amount of DWL.
* often through incentives supplied by the government so that the natural monopoly does not go bankrupt.

#### Integration
*how a company gains control of a market.*

**Vertical**
* Buying businesses that are part of the supply chain reduces costs and makes their production process more efficient.
	* Phone company → buys the company that makes the chips. Buys the retailers or the distributors (for the phone).
**Horizontal**
* Buying businesses in the same industry to take over the market share.
	* GOV DOES NOT WANT THIS. 
**Conglomerates**
* very big companies that sell lots of different products. ( horizontal integration but buying businesses in different industries.)
