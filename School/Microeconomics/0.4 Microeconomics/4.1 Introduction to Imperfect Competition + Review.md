*Unit 3 covered perfectly competitive markets. However, unit 4 turns that on its head by removing some of the assumptions of perfect competition. What happens when there aren't many firms? What happens when barriers to entry exist? What happens when there are differentiated products?*

Imperfect competitive markets exist because of high barriers to keep other firms from entering. 

**Types of Barriers to Entry**

* High fixed/start-up costs
	* Only one electric company bc they are the only ones that can make electricity at the lowest cost. This is a â€œnatural monopoly" -- no one can compete with the biggest mf.
* Geography or Ownership of Raw Materials
* Legal Barriers
	* patents

---
Imperfect Competition (IC) markets are "price makers" -- the firms have some or total control over the price at which they choose to sell their goods in the market.

The biggest difference between IC markets and perfectly competitive (PC) markets is the demand curve. 

* IC firms have have downward sloping demand curves. (Starts high goes low)
* The marginal revenue is NOT equal to the demand like in perfect competition.
	* because the MR decreases faster than the price (aka demand)
