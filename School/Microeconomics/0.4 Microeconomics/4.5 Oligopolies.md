Products sold are **differentiated**, but have close substitutes. (Think phones: Apple and Samsung)

Because there are so few firms in a market, the actions of firms will affect other firms: oligopolies are characterized by **interdependence** - *when the profit of each firm depends on the action of other firms.*

#### Types of Oligopolies

Cartels
* Group of firms with an agreement to work together to limit output and increase price, and therefore increase profit. They participation in "collusion".
	* collusion - *cooperate to raise joint profits.*

Non-colluding oligopolies
* firms compete and do not work together.

Duopolies
* two firms dominate the market.

#### Game Theory

Because oligopolies are bound by interdependence, the actions of firms will have an effect on the actions of other firms. 

Bottom line: individual firms will always prioritize their own personal gain, even at the expense of other firms. (More money, more good!)

So, with the goal of making the greatest profit possible, firms will take actions to maximize their earnings. These actions depend on -- and can change -- based on what other firms are doing.

> TFT. Lowkey a bit of a weak start. You look at the boards of the other players and you see one or two high-value boards. You think to yourself, "huh, win-streaking to Krugs here might not be an option. I should probably play for a solid loss-streak," so you examine the other remaining players to gauge your options.
> 
> One mf. Playing a "fortune" build: one that incentivizes the player to continue a loss-streak as long as possible, with the goal of eventually being able to "hit a cash-out" to skyrocket into a win. Hm... this fortune mf also seems to notice your weak af board... he emotes to acknowledge your ahh.
> 
> What do you do? What does he do? Y'alls options can be visualized -- and analyzed -- via a **payoff matrix.**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcyKzD8Zh69XKzmwZaEMrcyVq8OWwQCDV-t0kT5dqjl3dr5V2FC0MzS8bLxGGyEWIzQPKiT6LlBGfNU4-g_j70QFzv4Gb8q3W81j4HCiQdiq6VOEz8VoHhqitol6V2EKhGqziPJgw?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

*A payoff matrix is a chart that shows the actions of two firms and the payoffs of each combination of choices.*

So,
* if you win streak and he lose streaks, you earn $50 and he earns $100. (First quadrant).
* if you win streak and he win streaks, you earn $20 and he earns $20. (Second quadrant).
* if you lose streak and he lose streaks, you earn $20 and he earns $50. (Fourth quadrant)
* if you lose streak and he win streaks, you earn $70 and he earns $30. (Third quadrant)

Now, what should the fortune mf do?
* if you win streak, he should lose streak ($100)
	* because his only other option would be to win streak (which is only $20). He would naturally go for the option with greater profit.
* If you lose streak, he should... still lose streak ($50 > $30)

This is known as a **dominant strategy** -- what the firm (or player, in this case) should do **regardless of what the other firm does.**

> Side note: For "explaining" whether or not a firm has a dominant strategy:
> They do:
> 	"Yes, because Firm A will do X regardless of what Firm B does."
>They don't:
>	"No, because Firm A's decision is based off Firm B's choice."

Now what should you do?
* if he win streaks, you should lose streak ($70 > $20)
* if he lose streaks, you should win streak ($50 > $20)

In this case, you don't have a dominant strategy: your best choice ultimately will depend on what the other "firm" does.

However, remember that the fortune mf has a dominant strategy of **going loss streak**. To him, he will go loss streak any day of the week. 

So, if he goes loss streak, your best action is to go on a win streak. If he goes on a loss streak every time, you will thus go on a win streak every time.

This "equilibrium" is called the **Nash Equilibrium** - a situation where no player could gain by changing their own strategy.
* As, again, fortune mf will always go lose streak -- so you always have to go win streak to maximize your profit.

#### Practice Question

*Two bus companies, Roadway and Rankin Wheels, operate a route from Greensboro to Spring City, transporting a mix of passengers and freight. They must file their schedules with the local transportation board each year and cannot alter them during that year. Those schedules are revealed only after both companies have filed. Each company must choose between an early and a late departure. The relevant payoff matrix appears below, with the first entry in each cell indicating Roadway's daily profit and the second entry in each cell indicating Rankin Wheels' daily profit.*

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJPg_nWctD5v6pKr2HWiyUUzu-WUfc4kwUQKbHBxxtIkJvYCiWPt8pRAqLadQ4OQBfwht8ym5SW_lU-tLIX5RrXjrFcx72_KmZf2WzXV9PqYw6bHNdiaoeRdqNjMWT7ce52PQrug?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

1. In which market structure do these firms operate? Explain.

* Olipogoly (specifically a duopoly) because there are only two bus companies (two firms) and because their actions are interdependent.

2. If Roadway chooses an early departure, which departure time is better for Rankin Wheels?

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXew1iNDo4294xd369CRx1qJfexO4tlKYww44Dz6SbEDcfSyDtX55XGITY0NmkCdu7zIigWJmd9svEAcOse32nO-cQ1z5tbNfBVHzLNas3CVB7QEMqy-qPcTyjK4jjhG8ansepQJDA?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

* Early because 900 is greater than $850.

3. Identify the dominant strategy for Roadway.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4Gln_NpOP5bcVz_4EVUfx-DG05xmpOzz6JFlDdsreq0PihAd1kfGwCf6G7ElXtZHCyYkCYToOuRcGt4ZpiatbNLWKxV5MGxd5ADRU5TbktAoJbVvdCDdToGfcv_P-yp7AqylAFg?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

* Early. If Rankin Wheels went early, Roadway still goes early. If Rankin Wheels went late, Roadway will still go early. So, regardless of what RW does, Roadway will go early.

4. Is choosing an early departure a dominant strategy for Rankin Wheels? Explain.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfUAIIzYreues_RbqAxCifV_KZ7USrf6CE2b4AnnHSoOhvMc1LkPbnsOi7928-eSXjo7542r2UwVAeWykSADQE-Pe1FTIWdp1hvnlmkCb5dTk2qgwyBBNskUWZKd_AG0mNZI3MuSg?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

* No. If Roadway went late, then Rankin Wheels would opt to also go late. They earn $800 this way. (If RW went early instead, they would only earn $650)

5. If both firms know all of the information in the payoff matrix but do not cooperate, what will be Rankin Wheels' daily profit?

* If they do not cooperate, then both firms would produce at the Nash Equilibrium, which would be both going Early. So, Ranking Wheels would earn $900 profit a day.

#### Oligopolies in the real world type shiz

Antitrust Policy
*  efforts by the government to prevent oligopolistic industries from becoming or behaving like monopolies
	* The government prohibits mergers that it believes will reduce competition

Tacit Collusion
* When firms limit production and raise prices in a way that raises each other’s profits, even though they have not made any formal agreement
	* it is through tacit collusion that makes it hard for government officials to definitively prove collusion. 
* Strategic Behavior 
	* attempts to influence the future actions of other firms

Tit for Tat
* When firms are cooperating but then one firm betrays the other firm to achieve a greater profit (at the expense of the other firm).
* Naturally, the firm that got betrayed aint finna stand around and get taken advantage of. They also gonna play for their own personal gain now.
	* “I’m gonna do what you’re gonna do.” → both eventually settle on dominant strategies → NE

#### Constraints on Collusion (Factors that limit firms’ ability to collude)

Large numbers
*  the more firms there is in an oligopoly, the less incentive any one firm has to behave cooperatively

Complex Products and Pricing Schemes
* the more products sold, the harder it is to keep track of tacit agreements

Differences in Interest
* what is fair in one company may not be considered in another

Bargaining Power of Buyers
*  large retailers vs small retailers
* Price War
	* when tacit collusion breaks down and aggressive price competition causes price to collapse
---
Product Differentiation 
* convince buyers that the firm's product is different from the products of other firms in the industry
	* i.e. through advertising

Price Leadership
* one firm sets its price first, and other firms then follow

Firms that have a tacit understanding not to compete on price often engage in intense **nonprice competition**, using advertising and other means to try to increase their sales
* Think ads and all that fun shiz. 
	* Apple v Samsung ads -- they target and often mudsling the other as a form of competition.
