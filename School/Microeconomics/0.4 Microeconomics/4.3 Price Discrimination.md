*Where a firm charges different prices for the same product or service to different customers.*

**Requirements**

1. Monopoly power - control over the price
2. Elasticity - different consumers who are willing to pay different prices
3. Segregate - be able to find out how much everyone will pay
4. Cannot easily resell

**Different degrees of price discrimination**

* Level 1 (Perfect Price Discrimination)
	* no consumer surplus exists.
	* everyone pays the maximum amount of what they are willing to pay

* Level 2 
	* Charging customers based on what or how much they consume
		* E.g. parking based on time.

* Level 3 (Group Discrimination)
	* when companies price differently based on the unique demographics of subsets of their consumer base
		* child price vs. adult price

#### Perfect Price Discrimination Problems

Since Price Discrimination = charging every consumer a different price of their willingness to pay, **MR = D**.

**Add the new price + the previous TR**

1. Since MR = D, the profit-maximizing quantity is where MC = MR = D.
	* Since the point at MC = D is also the socially optimal point, **NO DWL** exists in perfect price discrimination. This should make sense --> we are satisfying every single mf's "needs" by charging them exactly what they are willing to pay.

2. Since we are milking every last drop from the consumer, no consumer surplus exists. All of it is changed into producer surplus.

3. Profit is found by Q(max P - ATC)
