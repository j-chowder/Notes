*used to determine whether or not changing the price of a good is worth it. Total Revenue is used to evaluate if you are making more or less money.*

* relates to elasticity to show how changes in price will affect total revenue.
* In an inelastic curve, price does not affect quantity (of demand) to a large degree. 
	* so if price increases and quantity does not decrease very much, there will be a net increase in TR. 
* In an elastic curve, price does affect quantity (demand) to a large degree.
	* So if the price increases, the quantity decreases a lot. There will be a net decrease in TR.

Inelastic
* An increase in price = increase in TR
* A decrease in price = decrease in TR

Elastic
* An increase in price = decrease in TR
* A decrease in price = increase in TR

Unit Elastic
* Price changes = TR remains the same.

*Shows how sensitive a product is to a change in **price of another good.***
Mathematically determines if two goods are substitutes or complements.

**Sign matters**

* if coefficient is positive (shows direct relationship) then the goods are substitutes
	* Q increases by 40% of A, P increases by 20% of B (40 / 20) = 2.
	* Therefore A and B are substitutes
		* Since price increases of B, the quantity increases of its substitute.
			* (Pepsi increases in price, so people would prefer to buy Dr. Pepper.)

* If coefficient is negative (shows inverse relationship) then the goods are complements.
	* Q decreases by 40% of A, P increases by 20% of B. (-40 / 20) = -2.
	* Therefore A and B are complements.
		* Since price increases of B, the quantity decreases of its complement as well.
			* (Hot dog wieners increased in price. Demand decreases. Because people buy less of hot dog wieners, the demand of hot dog buns would decrease as well.)
* if coefficient is 0, then the goods are not related. (shows no relationship).

*shows how sensitive a product is to a change in **income***
Mathematically determines if goods are normal or inferior.

* If the coefficient is positive (shows direct relationship) then the good is normal.
	* income increases, quantity increases. 
		* (Remember definition of normal goods)
* If the coefficient is negative (shows inverse relationship) then the good is inferior.
	* income increases, quantity decreases.
		* (Remember definition of inferior goods)
