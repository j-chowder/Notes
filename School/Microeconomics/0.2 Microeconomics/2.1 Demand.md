##### What is Demand?

* The desire, ability and **willingness** to buy a product.
	* Willingness ≠ desire. 
		* You can want something -- you would gladly receive it as a gift -- but you might not be willing to pay the cost to get it. 


**Law of Demand**

* Quantity demanded varies **inversely** with price.
	* When price goes up, quantity demanded goes down
	* When price goes down, quantity demanded goes up.

* Result of 3 different things
	* Law of Diminishing Returns ([[1.6 Marginal Analysis and Consumer Choice]])
	* Substitution Effect
		* If a price goes up for a product → consumers buy less of that product and more of another **substitute** product. 
			* i.e. pepsi increases in price, but coke stays the same → more demand for coke since people would rather buy that.
	* Income Effect
		* If the price goes down for a product, the purchasing power increases for consumers - allowing them to purchase more.

#### Demand Schedule & Demand Curve

*Shows the respective quantities demanded (how many people would buy) of a particular product at all prices that might prevail (are actually reasonable) in a market at a given time.*

A "demand schedule" is basically a table of (x, y) points for the actual "demand curve".
##### Drawing a Demand Graph

1. Price must be on y-axis
2. Quantity must be on x-axis
3. Starts top left  → curves bottom right.

Remember that when studying microeconomics, we assume a lot of things.

* Ceteris Paribus - *All other things held constant*
	* We only take account (1) changes in price and (2) changes in quantity when studying how demand -- and the graph -- is affected.

##### Change in ==demand==

* There is a change in demand, but price is not affected.
* Demand curve shifts horizontally (to reflect the changes in demand; not the change in price.)
	* people want MORE → more demand so the curve shifts to the right.
	* people want LESS  → less demand so the curve shifts to the left. 

##### Change in ==quantity demanded==

* There is a **change in price**.
* Demand curve does **not shift**; there is only movement **along** the curve itself. 
* According to the law of demand: when price goes up, fewer quantities are demanded. Likewise, when prices decline, more quantities are demanded.

* CURVE DOES NOT MOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Identify a reason why demand would change for a particular product:
	aka: “Determinants” of Demand

1. Tastes and Preferences
	* Umbrella term for anything that affects the customer's opinion of the good/service:
		* examples include:
			* new research about the effects of consuming the good
			* E. coli breakout in McDonalds
			* crazes/trends
2. Number of Consumers
	1. i.e. demand for ice cream during the summer >  demand for ice cream during winter
		* It's worth noting that "demand" is in respect to the entire market. So, a greater number of consumers --> larger demand in the market as a whole.
		
3. Price of related goods
	1. Substitution Effect
		1. Condom vs. Plan B
	2. Complements →  two goods are bought together
		1. Cucumber and Lube; Rope and Chair; boobs and milk 
4. Income
	*  Depends on the type of good
		1. **Normal Goods**
			* If you have enough money, you will buy it.
				* luxury cars, seafood, homes are examples in the **extremes** of normal goods. Most goods are "normal" - the more money a person has, the more they are able to buy things outside of basic necessities.
			* Demand is directly proportional with income.
		2.  **Inferior Goods**
			* Goods that people will want to **not own** if they had more money.
				* used, cheap car vs. a brand new Rolls Royce.
				* cup ramen vs. fresh ramen at a restaurant. 
			* Demand is indirectly proportional with income.

				* Think of inferior goods as a reluctant compromise. You don’t have enough money to actually buy something good, but you still wanna (or have to) buy it. Once you have more money, you would naturally opt for something **higher quality**.

5. Future Expectations
	1. i.e. hurricane season → stock up on water; covid-19 lockdowns → stock up on toilet paper.
	2. Or simply: "I know it will go up in price next month, so I'm gonna buy lots right now"

A market is a group of producers and consumers who exchange a good or service for payment.
* Food court with lots of different restaurant

A competitive market in which there are so many buyers and sellers of the same good or service, none of whom can influence the price at which the good or service is sold.
- Food court where every restaurant is McDonalds
