*a market is **efficient** if once the market has produced its gains from trade, there is no way to make some people better off without making other people worse off.*

* a policy that promotes equity can come at the cost of **decreased** efficiency.

##### Taxes

Regressive taxes - rises less than in proportion to income
* People who have less money **feel** the sales tax more.

Proportional taxes  - rises in proportion to income
* A tax that takes the same percentage of income from all income groups

Progressive taxes- rises more than in proportion to income
* graduated income tax.

#### Excise Taxes
* A per unit tax on **producers**

* For every unit made, the producer must pay $ NOT a lump sum tax (one time only).
* The goal is for them to make less of the goods that the government deems dangerous or unwanted
	* e.g.
		* cigarettes, alcohol, environmentally unsafe products.


1. Tax per unit
	* Determined by the vertical shift between pre-taxed and taxed supply curves
2. Tax paid by consumers
	* Area of the region above the P$_E$ to the y point dictated by P$_T$. The “base” is the Q$_T$
3. Tax paid by producers
	* Area of the region below the P$_E$ to the y point dictated by P of the original supply curve at Q$_T$. The “base” is the Q$_T$
4. Total Tax Revenue
	* Tax paid by consumers + tax paid by producers
5. Total spending / total revenue / total expenditures
	* The entire area
		* Logically speaking, the total spent is (how much is bought) x (the price).
		* So P$_T$ x Q$_T$ 
1. Total revenue for businesses.
	* Total revenue  - total tax revenue (the bottom half)
		* Logically speaking, the total revenue for businesses is the amount gained, minus the tax. So Q$_t$ x (the untaxed price)

The proportion of who pays -- the customer and producer -- is dependent on the elasticity of the curves.


Strictly looking at the demand curve:

More general:

When demand is more inelastic than supply, the tax burden will fall more on consumers than producers.

When supply is more inelastic than demand, the tax burden will fall more producers than consumers.

If demand is perfectly elastic, the entire tax burden will fall on producers.

If supply is perfectly elastic, the entire tax burden will fall on consumers. ​

Basically:

**the more inelastic the side is, the more they will pay the tax.**
* since that means the quantity is less sensitive to a change in price (so they do not care as much about taxation).

#### Costs of Taxation

* deadweight loss is the decrease in total surplus resulting from the tax, minus the tax revenues generated
* lump-sum tax is a tax of a fixed amount paid by all taxpayers
	* ignored from supply and demand curves bc its a one time payment.
* Administrative costs are the resources used by the government to collect the tax, and by taxpayers to pay (or to evade) it, over and above the amount collected.
