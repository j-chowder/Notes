As opposed to demand where we took the perspective of "the consumer," for supply, we will have a "producer mindset:" make the most amount of money possible.

The quantity supplied is the actual amount of a good or service people are willing to sell at some specific price.

##### Law of supply:

*Principle that suppliers will normally offer more for sale at high prices and less at lower prices*

* Again, taps into that mindset of minimizing as much opportunity cost as possible and maximizing marginal benefit.

Thus:

There is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

* As price of a good increases, the quantity provided increases.
* At low prices, the supplier will provide low quantities.

##### Increasing Marginal Costs

* As suppliers increase the quantity supplied of a good, they face rising marginal costs.
* As a result, they only increase the quantity supplied of that good if the price received is high enough to at least cover the higher marginal cost. 
	* Simply put: profit is important.

#### Supply Schedule and Supply Curve

* shows the various quantities of a particular product supplied at all possible prices in the market.
* Literally the complete opposite of the demand supply schedule/curve.

Since the supply curve is opposite of the demand curve, the supply curve starts at the bottom left and ends at the top right.

###### Change in Quantity Supplied

* change in amount offered for sale in response to a change in price 
* Movement along the curve.

###### Change in Supply

* shift on curve because of determinants.

It's important to note that these shifts (change in supply) are strictly horizontal (or with respect to the x-axis).

From S$_1$ to S$_3$, it looks like there was a movement upwards, but in reality, it was a shift to the left. The quantity supplied at the lower price points just simply became nonexistent -- there is now nothing supplied at those prices.

##### Shifters (Determinants) of Supply

1. Prices/Availability of Inputs (resources)
	* if it costs more to make, the quantity supplied at a certain price will decrease. Since making it will cost more, less will be made.

2. Prices of related goods or services.
	* substitutes/complements
		* sub example:
				Farming blueberries and grapes. If the price of blueberries increased, more land would be allotted to farm blueberries over grapes. So the supply of grapes would decrease.
	
	* taxes or subsidies
		* excise taxes are put on products by the government to discourage the purchase or encourage alternative behaviors.
			* e.g. taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Regulations that require firms to spend money to provide cleaner environment or safer workspace.
		* taxes cause the supply of a good to decrease

		* a subsidy is a government payment to a business or market
			* e.g. Tesla
			* subsidies cause the supply of a good to increase

	* From the firmâ€™s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies, however, reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right.

3. Producer Expectations
	* If producers expect the price of their product to rise in the future, they will supply less in the present and wait for the price to rise. 

4. Number of products/sellers
	* More suppliers would lead to greater supply.
		* Again, remember that "supply" is in regards to the whole market. Greater competition does hurt individual producers, but the overall supply of the good will increase. 

5. Technology
	* Can produce more with better technology.
