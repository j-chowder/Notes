World Price

* Countries can buy products at their own domestic price or they can buy the products at a **cheaper** world price
	* importing from 3rd world countries!!! YPIPPEE!!!
	* overall benefits the domestics consumers (since they get to buy at cheaper price) at the cost of hurting domestic producers. 

What is used to protect domestic producers and to prevent domestic unemployment:

Tariff

* Tax on imports that increases the world price.

Quota 

* A limit on the number of imports.
* Graphically shown as a vertical line at the quantity limit. 

To do World Price problems:

1. Find the quantity produced domestically
	* Where the world price intersects the supply curve. This basically means the quantity that producers are willing to supply at the world price.
	* **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdGkfwIHG6o0eB_IDhuIqg02pemeG1_3BdF5kKfW0nvZeTRaUauE4pZh2zy9JbgsGVOYVx_Sp1tgGy5PztqV_7LzcW_BrO6WYvRxqsIAOpJYDlBrNrBkpC8MY8MBDO7Jp1MBF68oBhukwLghb9qC5nxAEbe?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**
	* So Q = 5.
2. Find the quantity imported.
	* (Quantity where the world price intersects the demand curve) - (domestic quantity)
	* **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_usHaaTK5vYiYiHjTwyojOMPZ6jCNJZ99uH3ppi2Ga5UYLdpf33JQVsRTfsqKPRfTJ363Cdpv9OxMxNlkAAR2dBDkc3GA-3EutulQnYisFggrRoU4vwjvF396QANiB-IMAyRfbVUJtpClIw0bnaYiGfe7?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

3. Find the Consumer Surplus
	* Triangle formed from y-axis, demand curve, and world price.
4. Find the Producer Surplus
	* Triangle formed from y-axis, supply curve, and world price.

Note how large the consumer surplus is compared to the producer surplus -- this graphically shows how world price and imports favor consumers but hurt producers. 

With Tariffs:

1. Find the Consumer Surplus
	* Triangle formed from y-axis, demand curve, and taxed world price.
2. Find the Producer Surplus
	* Triangle formed from y-axis, supply curve, and taxed world price.

* Note how consumer surplus decreased and producer surplus increased from the previous untaxed world price situation.

3. Tariff Revenue
	* (Imported Quantity) x (price of the tariff)
	* ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXczhYwiB87JH1YboGFwhekRdXMVtE_j1l0II7R6gbz5s_jQz0sgzmloHYUPflfu3aXwbvOHm7rmAi-DpRsie-luSqYhOGIKRWghLQi1cWif6QxQRavsbaHWPDaFNmw-imiJjsOYkR9kgqT6T2kLHk3SiwG8?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)
		* So Imported quantity = (30 - 10) = 20.
		- Tariff = $0.50.
		- Tariff Revenue = 20 x $0.50 = $10.

4. Deadweight Loss
	* The tiny triangles after everything else has been filled in.

1. At the world price of $2 per pound, how much sugar is Loriland importing?
	* (total demand - domestic supply) = 14 - 2 = 12 million pounds
2. Suppose that Loriland imposes a per-unit tariff on sugar imports and the new domestic price including the tariff is $4.
	1. Identify the new level of domestic production
	2. Calculate the domestic consumer surplus for Loriland.
	3. Calculate the total tariff revenue collected by the government.

3. Given the world price of $2, what per-unit tariff maximizes the sum of Loriland's domestic consumer surplus and producer surplus?
	* Any tariff would result in deadweight loss = reduction in total surplus. So it would be $0.

Demand Price:

* Price at which consumers will demand that quantity.

Supply Price:

* Price at which producers will supply that quantity. 

A **quota** draws a wedge between the demand price and the supply price of a good.

* The quota rent is the difference between the demand price and the supply price.
* The quota rent = extra earnings that accrue to the license holders. 

Example:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpO9PHgNY7h2tuIrUWKAIgL6xMOYsGNJJGKEHRhSDGRwQl9T409GtmJtbWA8juI_6QmOdqpgpv4xcUWgPrpCjT9kaReIJtpx_3RVOPVwA1d6fyjSOdUUKeBabRQPy4--7YXV8AakLhdUipGTlEzN4o0ytm?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

a.) In the absence of government restrictions, what are the equilbrium price and quantity?

* P$_E$ = $10 
* P$_Q$ = 120k

b.) What is the demand price at which consumers wish to purchase 80,000 pounds of lobsters?

* $14.

c.) What is the supply price at which suppliers are willing to supply 80,000 pounds of lobsters?

* $8

d.) What is the quota rent per pound of lobster when 80,000 pounds are sold? Illustrate the quota rent and the deadweight loss on the diagram.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJMFVrC1rDR0lExwpVzPIJHtl8PgB-LJkzkxBc1ifxsKEIkJHBkOKdkIzmgN82qmlCfrq2ms3xONH5OhLJGrEkC59TgqRIWXH6Ebhe82QWQ9Tt5t_qkXUMrzEqCXff2PiQTHDbcQktvh5PKiEBv26ajrma?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

* Note that at the supply price of $ 8, Q$_D$ is 140k. Because of the quota, there is a shortage -- (Q$_S$ < Q$_D$) and thus the consumers of the market will PUSH up the price to as high as $14. Because a lot of producers would be willing to supply at a price of $14, **licenses** are required to limit the amount of sellers.
