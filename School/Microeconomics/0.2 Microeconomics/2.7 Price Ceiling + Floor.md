#### Price Ceiling

==Maximum== legal price a seller can charge for a product.

*Goal: Keep products affordable by keeping prices from reaching equilibrium.*

* ***Binding** - when a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, resulting in a **shortage** 

* ***Non Binding** - when a price ceiling is above the equilibrium price. (doesn't have an effect on the market price since producers would just continue to sell at equilibrium).

* Theoretically helps the consumer.

Note that the consumer surplus increases.

**inefficiencies of price ceilings**

* shortages
* inefficient allocation to customers
* wasted resources
* inefficiently low quality
	* Producers get less money, so they will look for ways to cut costs.
* black markets
	* At the new lower price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied which causes a shortage. Markets try to return to equilibrium, and one way this happens when shortages occur is the development of an illegal side market.
#### Price Floor

==Minimum== legal price a seller can sell a product.

*Goal: keep price high by keeping price from falling to equilibrium.*
* i.e. when the P$_E$ is disastrously low to the point where the producer can not profit.
	* often times associated with agriculture and farming.

* Since a price floor is above the equilibrium, a **surplus** is created (Q$_d$ < Q$_s$).

* Theoretically helps the producer.

Note that the producer surplus increases.

**inefficiencies of price floors**

* inefficiently low quantity
	* surplus of goods, so they can be trash
* inefficient allocation to sales among sellers
	* bigger businesses can afford to sell at a smaller margin.
* wasted resources
	* government purchase of agricultural products
* inefficiently high quality
	* luxury items
* illegal activity
	* get around price floors -- paying "under the table".

---
Note that for both a price ceiling and floor, **deadweight loss** exists.

This is because regulations like ceilings and floors results in a market that is **inefficient** -- where producers and consumers can not interact at equilibrium and thus some **surplus** will be wasted. That "waste" of surplus = deadweight loss.

If a market is able to work **efficiently** -- at equilibrium -- then no deadweight loss will be present.
