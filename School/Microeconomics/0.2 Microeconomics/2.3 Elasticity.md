*how much does change in price affect change in demand and supply?*

### Elasticity of Demand

“Relationship that shows how quantity of demand responds to price”

or

“*The extent to which a change in price causes a change in the quantity demanded.*”


Since price and demand are inversely related - the relationship between them will always be **negative**. *if, for some reason, the coefficient of PED turns out to be positive, it's defying the law of demand -- so it can't exist. Ms. Smelters says to just trash it.*

###### Inelastic Demand

*Quantity is insensitive to a change in price.*
* if price increases, quantity demanded will fall a little.
* If price decreases, quantity demanded increases a little.
	* In other words, people will generally continue to buy it regardless of price.

The demand curve is **steep** (since it requires a lot of change in price to affect quantity).

Characteristics of inelastic demand
* few substitutes
	* gas
* necessities
	* toilet paper, milk
* small portion of income (very cheap)
	* even if $1 → $2, (100% increase!!!) still very cheap, so price change does not affect quantity that much.
	* gum
* required now, rather than later.
	* going to doctors/hospital
* elasticity coefficient **less than 1.**

###### Elastic Demand

*Quantity is sensitive to a change in price*
* price increases, quantity demanded will fall a lot
* price decreases, quantity demanded will increase a lot.
	* The amount people buy is sensitive to price.

An elastic demand curve is **flat** (quantity change is more proportional to quantity change).

Characteristics of elastic demand
* many substitutes
	* beef, soda
* luxuries
	* real estate, pizza
* large portion of income
	* gold
* plenty of time to decide
* elasticity coefficient **greater** than 1.

You can not determine if a curve is elastic or inelastic just from looking at it -- it ultimately depends on the **values** (schedule) themselves -- it also depends on where you are on the curve.

---
###### Perfect Inelasticity
* elasticity coefficient = 0 (without rounding. has to be completely vertical).
	* ex: insulin for diabetics.
* no matter what happens to price, quantity remains the same.

###### Unit Elastic
* elasticity coefficient = 1
* percent change in quantity = percent change in price.

###### Perfectly Elastic
* Elasticity coefficient = ∞
* completely horizontal
* if the price changes at all, no one buys.

### Price Elasticity of Supply

Overarching question: *How easy is it to make more or less?*

How sensitive the quantity supplied is with respect to change in price. 

(Demand increases → price increases → price elasticity of supply is how fast/easily the supplier can produce and satisfy that demand (how well they deal with price change).)

There's a lot of nuance to this, so if it becomes ambiguous and confusing, always think back to -- "how quickly and effectively is the firm able to respond to increase in demand?"

i.e. "*rise of Chinese factories that monitor trends increases the elasticity of supply for toys because they make it possible to quickly react to the emergence of trends and fads.*"

Calculating the PES coefficient -- must be positive (since law of supply mandates Q and P to be directly proportional)

##### Inelastic Supply

*quantity supplied is insensitive to a change in price*
* As in, producers are not able to quickly and easily change # of supply to the change in price.
	* because of time-constraints, resource-constraints, etc.
* most goods have inelastic supply in the short-run

**Characteristics**
* hard to produce
* high barriers to entry (few firms)
* high cost or specialized imports 
* hard to switch from producing alternative goods (difficulty in specialization)
	* think manufacturing GPUs versus a restaurant. It is WAY easier to switch to a restaurant than it is to switch to a GPU producing factory. 
* Elasticity coefficient < 1

##### Elastic Supply

*quantity supplied is sensitive to a change in price*
* As in, producers are able to quickly and easily change supply to the change in price accordingly.
* most goods have elastic supply in the long-run

**Characteristics**
* easier to produce
* low barriers to entry (many firms)
* low cost or generic inputs (resources)
* easy to switch from producing alternative goods
* Elasticity > 1

short-run = short period of time where at least one factor of production is limited.
* i.e. a factory is already at max production
	* oranges are a limited resource. → limits the production of orange juice.
* may not be able to fully adjust to changes in demand.

long-run = where all inputs and decisions are flexible.
* Very little, if at all, constraints on the factors of production.



Generalizing the determinants of price elasticity of supply:

* resources
	* cost
	* amount available
	* how specialized they are
	* how quick it can be mobilized

* difficulty
	* in producing the good
	* in the specialization of workers/equipment/technology
	* in switching (between what goods you produced before and the goods you want to produce now) 
	* of barrier to entry/entering the market (how's the competition looking like).

---

##### Perfectly Inelastic Supply 

*Quantity of supply does not change, period.*

* Set quantity supplied (Vertical line).
* unique or irreplaceable items.
	* i.e. Leonardo Da Vinci's original paintings.
