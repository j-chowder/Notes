A competitive market is in equilibrium when the price has moved to a level at which the quantity demanded of a good EQUALS the quantity supplied of that good. 

To find the equilibrium point, simply look at the graph and find where both curves intercept.
* that tells you the "market price" as well as the equilibrium quantity.

##### Disequilibrium

Surplus - (Q$_s$ > Q$_d$)
* the surplus at a certain price point is calculated via Q$_s$ - Q$_d$ 
* There is a surplus because there is a surplus of goods that aren't being sold -- there is insufficient demand. 
* producers will lower price.

Shortage - (Q$_s$ < Q$_d$)
* The shortage at a certain price point is calculated via Q$_d$ - Q$_s$   
* there is a shortage because there is a shortage of goods - it can't keep up with the greater demand. 
* producers will raise price.
	* this is also why greater demand = greater price. The supply can't keep up with the demand (creating a shortage) and thus the price will go up.

*Why do all sales and purchases in a market take place at the same price?*

* people know more about the market (both buyers and sellers have been around for some time) -- sales and purchases tend to converge at a generally uniform price - (aka the "market price")
	* if a supplier raises the price, people will just buy somewhere else.
	* if a supplier lowers the price, they are getting scammed.


*Why does the market price fall if it is above the equilibrium price?*

* surplus of a good or service when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. (people aren’t able to sell goods)
* Surpluses occur when the price is above its equilibrium price (since less people buy since it is more expensive).
* Thus, suppliers will need to lower the price in order to sufficiently sell their goods.

*Why does the market price rise if it is below the equilibrium price?*

* shortage of goods or services when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.
* Shortages occur when the price is below its equilibrium price. 
* Thus, suppliers will increase the price. They are already selling out completely, so if they increase the price, they can earn more money while still ensuring that demand is still sufficient.

##### Changes in Supply and Demand

 (dealing with only 1 shift right now)
* A shift in either curve changes the equilibrium price
* A change in the supply curve does not cause a change in the demand curve and vice versa. 

General Steps:
1. Draw the normal curve **before change (normal equilibrium)**
2. Draw the change -- identify the shifter and whether S or D shifts (if any)
3. Compare the change -- (What happened to quantity and price?)
	* Note that demand shifts are direct  --> P↓ Q↓ 
	* Note that supply shifts are inverse --> P↑ Q↓ and vice versa.

If there is no change in demand, but rather a change in quantity (which means no shift determinants but price change)

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcS4tUTBdpWPLhV0sZRWZX4dO_pR7VHBTaoZF3AYsrXSaFY4g4YHKW0VT7jBLlAdmb3sC37-ftvaKPvAVvTX0FK_Lv2hLW_FXptIg9cEg4bIA638DIUjzrLNhZwmYjrE4du5Pcqit06yVHQ6BB05gWgvXoO?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

The curves, naturally, do not shift. But, since there is movement along the curve, the quantity will still change to react to the change in price. -- and thus the equilibrium point must change as well.

##### Double Shifts

Note again that one graph shifting **does not cause** a shift in the other. But, both graphs CAN shift at the same time. Correlation, not causation. 

1. Deal with one shift at a time. Note what happens to P and Q with each shift.
2. Because you don't know the **extent** to which the shift occurs, you can not tell the final outcomes of price and quantity solely off of the curves.
	* Compare the individual shifts in P and Q.
		* if either goes in the same direction for both shifts, that's good! You can confidently say determine the change.
		* if it goes different direction between shifts, that's no good! It is ambiguous and you must state that the change is "indeterminate / ambiguous".

Double Shift Rule:
* if two curves shift at the same time, EITHER price or quantity will be indeterminate (again, because it ultimately depends on the degree of the shift in curves)

What really helps for me is to remember that price and quantity for demand is directly proportionate (if Q go up, P go up) and that price and quantity for supply is inversely proportionate (if Q go up, P go down). 
* e.g. if you know supply curve shifts right, then Q is obviously ↑. So, because P is inversely proportional, P will ↓.

| Double shifts | Supply inc   | Supply dec   |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Demand inc    | P: ?<br>Q: ↑ | P: ↑<br>Q: ? |
| Demand dec    | P: ↓<br>Q: ? | P: ?<br>Q: ↓ |
* note that I put ? to indicate that it is indeterminate, but you MUST state in actual FRQs and shiz that it is "indeterminate / ambiguous" 

Example:

(1)
**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdIBAaaIGkxcaGz9JWuiIsuY99kKrYxogxuOg0uLBepvqIRUe37jGD-EfXs9rO_7h1NZkYXgR3QDsLK30jrNtsU4Xknxf677FBO87N7cJbUVaJQj6T8cFWcYHQDvtMF-NLibait0sgSH5hOGlB8CkA4WmQ?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

Draw the shift for demand first, note the shifts in p and q. (both ↑)

(2)

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeT0X1wg7_-sNB0an90T_yiL9ichOV5e3co_l6jVzmU7hAqXdNtzreR54uWWS5DvKiahOAdEZG7epIQ8zq-P8xbTyA7angFBW9n__gz5HD-ktbtM0y0vdZmqagEW7XUuxhRiE6Lb8e6GL3_-yvuXuoVwzh7?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

Now draw the shift for the other, again note the shifts in p and q (with the reference being the original curve of the other). (Q ↑ and P ↓)

(3)
compare the changes in price and quantity between both shifts.

In the demand curve shift:
Q: ↑
P: ↑

In the supply curve shift:
Q: ↑
P: ↓

Since Q increased in both, we can confidently say that Q overall increases.
But, since P is the opposite in both, we can not make a clear statement. So we have to state that the change in P is indeterminate/ambiguous.
