#### Returns to Scale -- (only looking at production, not costs).

The relationship between a company’s output and its production inputs over time.

E.g. assume that you run a factory producing TVs.

* if you double all your inputs (like workers, tools, and machines) what three possible scenarios could happen to your output.

1. If your output more than doubles then you have **increasing returns to scale**. 
	* You gain **more** than what you put in.
	* Output > Input
2. If your output doubles then you have **constant returns to scale**
	* You gain the **same** as you put in.
	* Output = Input
3. If your output less than doubles then you have **decreasing returns to scale**
	* You gain **less** than what you put in.
	* Output < Input.

#### Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)

LRATC curves are found by taking the lowest short-term average total cost (SRATC) curves **at each level of output.**

What I mean with "each level of output:"

1. I make looms out of my garage with one saw.
2. I rent out a building, buy 5 saws, and hire 3 workers.
3. I rent a factory, buy 20 saws, and hire 40 workers.
4. I build my own plant and use robots to build looms
5. I create plants in every major city in the U.S.
6. I own Mars. I own the Milky Way. I put factories in every acre of land. I enslave the entire human race. Every robot is owned by me. 

It's a scaling process that progressively improves production efficiency (1-5) until the point where it's overkill (6).

Each individual SRATC curve encompasses each output level -- the LRATC is formed via connecting each SRATC curve (that depicts different stages of fixed costs) into one individual curve.

(1) is when production is beginning and the firm is not using its entire plant capacity. The low production hinders mass production, causing the ATC to be very high.

As the firm continues production (2-5), its growing capacity enables **mass production** and **specialization** to take place, which leads to the point where ATC is at its lowest.
* Note that though total cost will be higher, ATC will go down because we are getting more bang for our buck.

As the firm expands and its output becomes larger than its plant capacity, it becomes too big to manage. Its costs per unit begin to rise again. This is the point where there is too much input needed, SRATCs rise (6).

#### Economies of Scale
* The influence of **scale** is what determines the shape of the long-run average total cost curve.

**Economies of scale** 
* ATC decreases as a firm increases production. In this phase, the firm can reduce its total cost-per-unit by boosting its plant capacity and output.

**Constant returns to scale**
* ATC stays the same as a firm increases production. This is where ATC is the lowest. This is also the transition between 'economies of scale' and 'diseconomies of scale.' 
* Does not always exist.

**Diseconomies of scale**
* ATC increases as the firm increases production. In this phase, the firm would be better off reducing its plant capacity and output in order to lower their per-unit costs.

**Minimum efficient scale**
* the smallest quantity at which a firm’s long run average total cost is minimized.
* it is the balance point at which a company can produce goods at a competitive price.

#### Sunk Cost

* a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. It should be ignored in a decision about future actions.
