Note:

A firm enters a market when it opens business and begins selling product.
* So when quantity produced and sold ≠ 0.

A firm exiting the market ≠ completely going out of business. Instead, a firm exiting a market means the firm has decided not to produce any quantity.
* So when quantity produced and sold = 0.

#### The Shut-Down Rule

Remember that in the short run, there will always be a fixed cost regardless of quantity, even if **quantity is zero**. 

Which means that 

* A firm should continue to produce as long as the price (aka MR - marginal revenue) is above the AVC.
	* Or when TR is above TVC. 
* When the price falls below AVC then the firm should minimize its losses by shutting down.
	* If the price is below AVC the firm has a loss that is bigger than the fixed cost

*If you're confused: total cost is composed solely of VC and FC. If you cover all of variable cost and some (MR > AVC), then you only have the FC left to cover. WHICH MEANS THE LOSS THAT YOU INCUR FROM PRODUCING AND SELLING THE PRODUCT WILL BE LESS THAN THE FIXED COST.* 

*If you cannot cover your costs for producing goods, then you shouldn't produce any goods at all. Instead, take the hit on your fixed costs only.*

Note that comparing total cost (ATC/TC) with revenue (MR/TR) determines the **profit or loss** of the firm. Naturally, if MR > ATC, then revenue is greater than total cost, generating profit for the firm.

But note that a firm only decides to **shutdown**... if MR < AVC.

AVC is used to determine whether or not a firm **should continue producing or not** -- it only determines if the firm has a loss that is bigger than the fixed cost. NOT THE PROFIT.

A firm can have a 
* MR that is below ATC.
	* They are not making a profit.
* But a MR that is above AVC.
	* MR is greater than the fixed cost.

This means that the firm has a **short-run loss**. They are losing money but that does not warrant them shutting down.
*  This basically occurs when your fixed cost will be greater than the losses the firm incurs from producing and selling their product.
	* i.e. the factory has a lease for a year that is $100,000. If you produce and sell NOTHING, you will need to pay $100,000, as it is a fixed cost.
	* But if you decide to make shiz, your losses become $80,000. That's still a loss, but you effectively gain/save $20,000 from the alternative.

As ATC > AVC, you only ever consider comparing MR with AVC if you are already incurring a loss. It is a subsequent step to help the firm decide whether or not to shut down and cut losses, or continue producing to minimize losses. Naturally, if MR > ATC, then MR > AVC as well.

#### Firm's short-run supply curve?

The firm's short‐run supply curve is the portion of its marginal cost curve that **lies above its AVC curve.**

Remember the profit-maximizing rule:

* A firm produces at a quantity where MR = MC.

So, for any MC below AVC (if a firm is producing at a quantity where MR is below AVC) then it is (1) at a loss and (2) should shut down (according to the shut-down rule).

Which means that a supply-curve would **not exist where MC < AVC**, as the firm would be better off shutting down and producing nothing.

Conversely, a supply-curve would only **exist where MC > AVC**, as that is a requirement for a firm to even be producing and supplying products.

#### Long-Run Decisions

Remember that in the long run, all inputs are variable, meaning a firm can completely avoid their costs by exiting the market (since no costs are fixed in the long-run!).

Which means that 

- a firm would want to enter a market if they earn a profit. 
- And firms would start to leave the industry in the long run if they are earning a loss.

###### Barriers to Entry

Say a firm sees other firms popping off in a certain market -- making massive profits. Hence, the firm would want to enter so that they can make money.

Regardless if they want to enter or not, what ultimately determines if they **can enter** are:

**barriers of entry** - factors that prevent new firms from entering a given market.

* A market with **low** barriers has more competition and individual firms make less profit.
	* i.e. restaurants. 
* A market with **high** barriers has less competition and individual firms make more profit.
	* i.e. GPU manufacturers. Plane manufacturers.


Practice:

For these 6 pictures, identify if the market has a **low or high barrier of entry.**

Correct. They are all markets with low barriers of entry.  Hence why a lot of minorities -- especially those that are unskilled immigrants -- enter these markets. 

As much as they want to make $ with very profitable markets, they often can not... due to their high barriers of entry. So they are left with markets that have low barriers of entry.
