*Every good or service is sold within a market structure. The four main market structures and their characteristics are:*

| Characteristic          | Perfect Competition                    | Monopolistic Competition    | Oligopoly                  | Monopoly             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Number of Firms         | MANY                                   | Many                        | Few (less than 10)         | One Large Firm       |
| Product Differentiation | Identical                              | Different                   | Identical or Different     | Unique product       |
| Control Over Price      | None -- Price Fakers                   | Some control - Price Makers | Substantial - Price Makers | Total - Price Makers |
| Barriers to Entry       | LOW                                    | Low                         | High                       | HIGH                 |
|                         | No non-price competition<br>(i.e. ads) |                             |                            |                      |
| Example                 | Agriculture Potatoes                   | Food Court                  | Airlines                   | Utilities - Electric |

#### Barriers of Entry

* Economies of Scale
	* i.e. Natural Monopoly via being able to make something cheaper than anybody else.
* Superior Technology
* Geography or Ownership of Resources
* Government created barriers
	* i.e. patents

Again... THIS SHIZ SHOULD BE GLUED INTO YOUR BRAIN ALREADY:

Optimal Output Rule

Profit is maximized where MR = MC.

#### Demand for Perfect Competitive Firms

Why are they "price takers":

* Since there are so many firms and suppliers available, if a firm charges above the market price, NO ONE will buy. Customers will just go to other firms.
* There is no reason to price low because consumers will buy just as much at the market price. (In short, you are getting scammed. Remember that TR = Q * P)

* Since the price is the same at all quantities demanded, the demand curve for each firm is: **perfectly elastic** (horizontal line).

This line also represents the
1. Price (P)
2. Marginal Revenue (MR)
3. Average Revenue (AR)

Which is acronymed to MR DARP (MR=D=AR=P)

*Quick note on Allocative Efficiency: 

* occurs when the distribution of resources maximizes the total benefit received by all members of society.
* Basically when the price of a good or service reflects the marginal cost of producing it, ensuring that **consumer preferences align with producer costs.**

#### Graphs in Perfect Competition

**General steps for drawing these side-by-side Perfect Competition curves**

1. Start with the traditional supply-and-demand curve. Identify P$_E$ on that curve
2. That same price gets transported to the graph on the right. Draw the horizontal MR DARP curve.
3. Then draw the MC curve, (and more than likely, ATC and AVC curve).
	* Remember that where MC  = MR is the profit-maximizing quantity.
	* Remember that the position of ATC relative to MR will determine the firm's profitability.
4. Do demand/supply curve shifts if prompted. The price change will be reflected on the MR DARP curve as well.

**General steps for reading side-by-side Perfect Competitino Curves**

1. Find where MR meets MC. Calculate output, total revenue.
2. Calculate total cost from where ATC meets quantity.
3. Compare ATC with the intercept of MR = MC.
	* If intercept > ATC, then the firm is earning a profit. Yay!
	* If intercept < ATC, then the firm is incurring a loss. Move to step 4.
4. Compare AVC with the intercept of MR = MC.
	* If intercept > AVC, keep producing.
	* If intercept < AVC, shut down.

Note that the individual firm shifts in P are the same as the market shifts in P. However, Q differs.

For individual firms, just think about the Law of Supply. (price and quantity are directly proportional).

Hence why P ↓ = Q ↓ and P ↑ = Q ↑ for individual firms.

#### Long Term Analysis

If an individual firm is currently making a loss:
* Other firms would leave the market (as they are losing money)
	* So supply will decrease.
* As a result, equilibrium/market price will increase.
* --> MR=D=AR=P shifts up. 

If an individual firm is currently making a profit
* Other firms would join the market (as there is profit to be found)
	* Supply will increase
* As a result, equilibrium/market price will decrease.
* MR=D=AR=P shifts down.

Because firms are able to freely enter and exit in response to potential profit, this means that in the long-run firms cannot **make economic profit**; they can only break even (normal profit).
* The market balances itself out to the “equilibrium” where each firm has normal profit.

So, at a perfectly competitive long-run equilibrium, ALL firms break even, they make NO economic profit.

==Note, though, that firms are still making **positive accounting profits.** All cost curves in microeconomics are in terms of **economic cost**, which will never be greater than accounting cost.==

This is represented graphically with this: Note how ATC has its balls planted on the intercept of MC = MR. They all meet at the same place so MR = MC = ATC.

#### Long Run Production Decision

* The long run market equilibrium is when Q$_s$ = Q$_d$ as long as there has been enough time for other firms to enter and exit the market.
	* Enough time where every mf can decide whether or not they want to enter or leave.

#### Shifting of Cost Curves

Sometimes, you will be given scenarios where you start in long-run equilibrium, and then you are given a situation that changes demand in the market. This shift of demand moves the market into short-run, and then it has to readjust back to long-run.

1.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd7A0RrDO9HWqJniDwl73FiFGE5xGJc12xf5_5qVup4ghouskJFniTucoP6pFfNHPGgv0B4S0lGDXWLES3SAR8C3bB5T_PgUQLgT0_wvmgb39w1Ugf0JVVHoJqsxRybj0x5IOG5wg?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

Demand shifts to the right because of blah blah blah and P$_E$ increases. As a result, MR DARP moves up and a new profit maximizing point is created.

This causes the firm to go from long-run equilibrium to **short-run profit** since the price line is **above the ATC curve.** (as MR = MC = ATC prior due to equilibrium)

2.
**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegUVgJd-pytMEu0ghK3UfTMzC9194tzzJIBKOr8WtH26SAZYgVvbwOldPIK8k-QFW_MX9teRw3-aZ1lRRCZvqclkDXOZQ_81oaaet1I3CmTMGWwHhz-Vqc1Qka5N4igUQNFTRdBA?key=mVF1W1TrBFF1vodp-5EllQ)**

Since the market is earning a short-run profit, individual firms want to enter the market to harvest that potential profit, like rancid Forty-Niners. 
* (Imagine the girls that never talk to a guy until the guy brings sweets and suddenly he's the rizzlord)

Anyways, since there are more firms, the supply curve shifts right, and P$_E$ decreases. So MR DARP drops, causing the profit-maximizing quantity to return to the original one in the firm.
* Boom. Next day, the mf has no more sweets. The girls never talk to him again. 

BOTTOM LINE: **The market always has to readjust to long-run equilibrium.**

#### misc shiz you need to know

A change in fixed costs changes ATC and AFC (but not MC)
- As the difference in cost between making 0 goods and 20 goods is independent of fixed cost.
A change in variable costs changes ATC, AVC, & MC.
- i.e. making 20x more robots will require 20x more metal. 

We have been assuming that we are in a **constant cost industry** - or that the exit and entry of firms has no impact on the cost curve. Basically, we are assuming that the only factors that can affect price of a product are shifts in supply and demand. 

However,  **increasing cost industries** and **decreasing cost industries** do exist IRL.

Increasing Cost Industry:
* more firms enter market = supply ↑ = demand of resources and shiz to produce the product ↑ = price of the resources ↑ = increasing cost industry.  
	* imagine an apple juice market. There is only so many apples that can be generated from apple farms.  As more firms join the market to make their own apple juice, the price of apples (the resource) themselves will increase.

Decreasing Cost Industry
* Despite more firms entering the market, the price of resources ↓. This might be due to 
	* business expands, so purchasing inputs in bulk is more feasible.
	* technology improves as a result of lots of traction and relevance.
	* economies of scale.


*“The cost that you have stays constant. So, umm… in… this chart. If you look ALLL the way over to the right hand column, top row is a constant industry, short run long run price stays the same. OURS is not. So… in that long run ATC curve. We are looking at the bottom of that curve.. where we have constant cost. Kay… if our costs are increasing, that means we are in… the portion of the graph where we are in diseconomies of scale, that is the part of the curve where we are starting to go back up…. since our cost is rising. In a decreasing cost industry…  curve.. we are in economies of scale, as more firms enter the industry… our cost is. going. down. So, the safe thing to assume is that if they do not tell YOUUU, then it is a constant cost industry. But again, increasing cost industry and decreasing cost industry -- industries… do EXIST.” (R.
