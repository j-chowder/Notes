### A firm has its profits maximized at the quantity where MR = MC.

Marginal Revenue (MR) is change in total revenue (TR = P x Q) generated by an additional unit of output. MR = ∆TR/∆Q
* This is just another form of Marginal Benefit (MB) that we learned in Unit 1: [[1.6 Marginal Analysis and Consumer Choice]]. 
* Therefore, every activity should continue until the MB (in this case, MR) = MC.

#### So why when MR = MC?

A firm can exist in 3 positions:

1. MR > MC

> When MR > MC, the firm has the **potential** to earn more marginal profit (MR - MC > 0) for the next product it produces. It has the ability to keep on producing... which means more money!!! This means it should keep producing units while MR > MC.

2. MR < MC

> When MR < MC, the firm actively **loses** profits by producing an additional unit, so a firm should scale back production.

3. MR = MC

> Therefore profit is maximized where MR = MC. Goldilocks situation.

Example to ram it home:

Stage 4-1. Level 7. 70 gold. You're in the bottom 4 in terms of HP. Naturally, MR > MC here. You **need** to roll to stabilize your board, otherwise you will continue that loss streak.

You've stabilized your board. Solid 3 win-streak; Now 4th in terms of HP. 50 gold. Rolling here would be MR < MC. You're wasting your money by rolling instead of saving up to level. 

Top 2. Level 9. 20 gold. Final battle. You roll down everything and manage to hit your 2-star 5 cost. MR = MC. Profit is maximized. You win the game.
