#### Characteristics of Perfectly Competitive Labor (Factor) Markets

* Many, small firms hiring workers - like perfect competition, which had many sellers, a perfectly competitive labor market has many buyers
	* No one firm is large enough to manipulate the market
* Many workers with identical skills
* Wage is constant
* Workers are **wage-takers**
	* Firms can hire as many workers as they want at a wage set by the industry

It is the absolute same shiz as [[3.7 Perfect Competition]] but just "flipped."
