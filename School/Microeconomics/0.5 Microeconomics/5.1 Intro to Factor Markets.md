aka resource markets.
### The factor market is where the factors of production are sold by households to businesses.

Again, the factors of production ([[1.1 Basic Economic Concepts]]) are 
1. land
2. labor
3. capital
4. entrepreneurship

The main idea of microeconomics is still present: 
* suppliers --> provide goods --> for consumers.

But now we are shifting our perspective from a **product market** (businesses sell to individual consumers) to instead the Average Joes -- households  -- as the protagonist of this fantasy story: **factor market**

* The suppliers are now the household and the consumer is now the company/firm.
	* The household offers something -- usually labor (aka they work there as an employee) -- to the company; again the principles of law of supply and demand apply.
		* In this case, the household represent the supply and the company represent the demand of that good.

For the factors of production mentioned above, the corresponding payments for those factors are:

1. land = rent
2. labor = wage
3. capital = interest
4. entrepreneurship  = profit.

Basically what is paid to the households in exchange for providing said factor of production.
* some Mexican gardener will earn a wage for working their ahh off.
* a landlord will earn rent from their tenants
* a shareholder will earn interest from investing in a company
* a director will earn profit from producing absolute cinema.
#### Labor Demand and Supply

It's literally the same mashed potatoes.

**Demand**
* There is an INVERSE relationship between wage and quantity of labor demanded.
	* the number of workers that businesses are willing to hire increases as the wage falls.

**Supply**
* There is a DIRECT (or positive) relationship between wage and quantity of labor supplied.
	*  the number of workers that are willing and able to sell their labor increases as the wage increases.

Note:
* In real life, workers have different trade-offs between work and leisure. One worker might value working remote to the point of willingly taking a job that pays $20k less. Another worker might prioritize/value higher the job that pays $20k more.

**Derived Demand**
* In the factor market, the demand for resources is determined (derived) by the products they help to produce.  
	* i.e. the demand for carpenters is derived from the demand for homes. If there was a spike in demand for new houses, demand for carpenters will increase as well.
* Society determines the value -- and thus the demand -- of the resource.
