- Illustrates the trade-offs facing an economy that produces only two goods.
- Shows the maximum quantity of one good that can be produced for each possible quantity of the other good produced.
- Goal is to shift outward and expand (this indicates economic growth).

A, B, C, are efficient output combinations that fully utilize the resources.
- Note that A, B, and C are efficient output combinations (achieves productive efficiency), but they might or might not be appealing to the consumers/society (allocative efficiency)

D is an inefficient combination - not all resources fully utilized.

E is an output combination that is not yet attainable. (But is the goal)

An economy achieves allocative efficiency if it produces at the point along its production possibilities curve that makes consumers as well off as possible.

Opportunity cost = the opportunity lost.
- The financial or nonfinancial cost of a choice not taken.

- At A you make 50 biscuits, 16 cheese.
- At B you make 30 biscuits, 26 cheese.

The opportunity cost from A to B is 20 biscuits.
The opportunity cost from B to A is 10 cheese.
- (Whatever number gets smaller is the opportunity cost)


Law of Constant Opportunity Cost
- as the more of a good is produced, the opportunity cost does not change.
- The opportunity cost stays constant.

- More similar products (e.g. bicycles and tricycles) are more likely to be constant opportunity cost. The resources are very similar, and there is no extra specialization needed.

Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost
- As the more of a good is produced, the greater its opportunity cost.
- Opportunity cost does not stay constant. It increases.

- More different products (e.g. oranges and phones) are more likely to be increasing opportunity cost since the resources, specialization, and technology needed are completely different.

Zooming out...

Economic Growth is a sustained rise in output and in increase in the standard of living.

When something experiences economic growth, the production of the possibility curve moves outward, expanding the set of production and consumption.. the ability to produce a larger total output over time.
- Done via
	- increase in resources, either quantity or quality.
	- Technological advancements.

Change in demand only affects the point on the curve, it does not shift the curve. You just allocate the resources differently to prioritize a product over the other.

Only the **quality** of `labor` can shift the curve. A **reduction** of labor shifts the point within the original curve, but does not affect the curve itself.

- higher quality labor allows you to utilize the other resources **more efficiently** - so you can use the same amount of resources to produce more. Curve shifts outward. Better workers indirectly affect the resources to be greater in quality and/or quantity.

- Firing workers does reduce the amount of labor, but the resources themselves stay the same. Remember that the PPC curve represents the **efficient use of resources.** The curve does not shift because (1) resources are unaffected (2) the curve indicates the products that can be made IF done efficiently. The point thus goes within the curve because the resources are being underutilized (and thus inefficient). 
	- Don't treat `labor` as a resource - it is a means of efficiency and how resources are utilized.


* Increasing the number of workers does not shift the curve outwards. Why? Because the **amount of resources** themselves remain the same. 
* For instance, say you only have 10 wheels. If each bicycle costs 2 wheels, you can only make a maximum of 5 bicycles. Say you hired 10 workers instead of 5 workers. Yes, producing the bicycles will be faster, as each worker can be in charge of one wheel, but there won't be MORE bicycles being made. 10 wheels can only ever make 5 bicycles.
