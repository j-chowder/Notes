*Marginal analysis is making decisions based on increments.*

*You will continue to do something as long as the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost.*

##### Marginal Utility

- the added satisfaction a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service.
	- Measured in “utils”
-  (n - (n-1)) of the utility to get marginal utility/benefit.
	- where n is the # of product consumed.


You stop consuming a product where the marginal utility/benefit equals the marginal cost. (or the closest it gets before the MB < MC)

You want to keep doing it/buying it/consuming it until marginal utility = marginal cost because there is untapped potential.

##### Law of Diminishing Returns

*As more of a product is consumed, total utility increases at a diminishing rate, reaches a maximum and then declines.*

- only applies to the same good. i.e. eating different cakes resets the utility. Eating the same cake over and over has diminishing returns.

##### Marginal Utility Per Dollar & Utility Maximization

MU/P = marginal utility per dollar.

Utility Maximization
- Limited money, look for a combination that maximizes utility.
	- Purchase goods with highest MU/P (if there is equal MU/P, choose the cheaper one) until out of money.

- i.) 10 + 8 + 6 = 24 utils.

- ii.) First thing we need to do is calculate the MU/P of all products and their quantities. 


| Quantity | MU from Bagels | ==MU/P from Bagels== | MU from Toy Cars | ==MU/P from Toy Cars== |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1        | 8              | ==4==                | 10               | ==10==                 |
| 2        | 7              | ==7/2==              | 8                | ==8==                  |
| 3        | 6              | ==3==                | 6                | ==6==                  |
| 4        | 5              | ==5/2==              | 4                | ==4==                  |
| 5        | 4              | ==2==                | 3                | ==3==                  |
| 6        | 3              | ==3/2==              | 2                | ==2==                  |

There are two different methods of maximizing utility.

1. Just go down the list from highest MU/P to lowest until you run out of money.
2. Find MU/Ps that match between the products. 
	1. i.e. both bagels and toy cars have an instance where MU/P = 4,  where MU/P = 3, and where MU/P = 2.
	2. These ensure proper breakpoints between combinations.
	3. If the first breakpoint does not work, keep going. You had more money than expected! Har har har!
3. Answer: 3 bagels, 5 toy cars.
