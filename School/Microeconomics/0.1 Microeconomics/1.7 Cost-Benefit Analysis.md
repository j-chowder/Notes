*The total cost of doing something is the value of all things given up to do that thing (explicit or implicit)*

---

Explicit costs 
- Direct out-of-pocket costs

Implicit Costs  
- Value of the next best thing / the opportunity cost.

Ex:

##### *Going to college*

* The explicit cost would be the tuition.

* The implicit cost would be the experience and money you could have gained from working at a job during the time you are in college.

**Overarching question:** Is the total benefit greater than or equal to the total cost?

*Note that the total benefit of a decision really depends on the person making the decision - each personâ€™s willingness to pay is different. Satisfaction in itself is completely subjective.*
