### Tips for Unit 1 in general

1. I'm not kidding, don't get lost in the sauce.
2. Have an order of operations - you aren't him.
	1. Try the methods you have learned in this order:
		1. splitting up the fractions (when denominator is only 1 term)
			1. Don't confuse this with partial fractions
		2. u-sub
		3. inverse trig (try to see if you can complete the square.)
			1. If you can do **both** partial fractions or completing the square to fit an arctan, just do arctan. 
		4. partial fractions // long division
		5. integration by parts
		6. triangle trig sub.

For trig:

1. Try doing it with a bottom-up approach:
	1. Try to see if you can just change identities and solve like that.
	2. Don't just instantly jump into the strategies we learned in this unit.
	3. Sometimes you will need to do double angle. This is the last resort.
	4. Nope. Last resort is triangle trig sub.
