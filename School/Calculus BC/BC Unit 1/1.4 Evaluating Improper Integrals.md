Remember back to the definition of integrals: it is a limit of Riemann Sums. 

What we have learned so far has allowed us to integrate "proper integrals" without the need to find the limit. 

Proper Integrals are:
1. functions that are defined and bounded on the interval `[a, b]`
2. where the limits of integration do not approach ∞.
3. where the discontinuities only ever reach "point discontinuities."

---

Improper Integrals, however, are when 

1. either `a` or `b` is ∞
2. somewhere in `[a, b]` has an infinite discontinuity. (i.e. vertical asymptote)

Things to note:

1. The end goal is to try and evaluate integrals in which we weren't capable of integrating prior - due to a part of the curve being undefined. There are two outcomes:

	1. It "converges" - which means that the limit exists.
	2. It "diverges" - which means that the limit is undefined. 

2. So in order to actually be able to integrate the improper integral, we replace the infinity (or the value that makes the term undefined) with a variable. "a" for the lower bound and "b" for the upper bound.
3. Then we cheese this shiz by just setting the variable to what made it DNE (or infinity). So it's kinda like "yippee same thing :nerd:"
4. Remember that evaluating an improper integral is really 2 problems - It is an integral problem and THEN a limit problem.

1. Normally, this integral would not be legal.
2. Just replace ∞ with an actual tangible variable, making it possible to integrate.
3. THEN, we find the limit of n to ∞. ln(∞) = ∞, so this integral is divergent.

1. Note that both the upper and lower bound are ∞.
2. So we need to separate the integral into two separate integrals. The bounds in between doesn't matter - just make it something easy to work with, like 0.
3. Then replace ∞ with the variables, and make it a limit.
4. Integrate, then find the limit.
	1. This one is kinda tricky cuz it's the inverse of a trig function. Yeah... you gotta know these.
5. Simple as that!

1. This one's a tad bit more tricky. You will need to be able to recognize when a term (with the bounds) are undefined. For this one, ln(0) is undefined. 
2. Hence we replace 0 with a, and then set it up as a limit. We go from the "right ( 0$^+$)" because the function does not exist on the left.

1. Again, finish integrating with the upper bound and lower bound.
2. Then find the limit. ( idk why (0)ln(0) = 0, ig 0 is stronger than -∞ ).
3. We are left with -1, so this integral is convergent.

1. Note that there exists an infinite discontinuity in (a, b) - at x = 1.
2. So you gotta split and then replace the 1 with a variable.
3. Proceed as normal!

1. Ok: this is a niche but something you should definitely know, cause it will cost you points.
2. When there is infinity divided by infinity, depending on the actual terms, the value can become 0, or it can become infinity.
3. In this case, it became 0 because **the denominator is increasing FASTER than the numerator.** e$^x$ (exponential growth) grows faster than x (linear growth). Hence the denominator will ALWAYS be bigger than the numerator, given the same value.

"*The exponential function e$^x$ grows faster than x$^p$ for any p > 0. Polynomial functions x$^p$ grow faster than logarithms. Logarithmic functions are the slowest growing type.*" - some random website.

if it spawns with a variable first, then assume it's a tangible number that makes the integrand dne; only deal with infinity if it spawns in the problem itself.
