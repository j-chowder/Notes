Sometimes u-sub doesn't work for rational expressions.

You use partial fractions when 

1. u-sub doesn't work
2. the denominator can turn into - or has - at least two factors. 
	1. e.g. (x + a)(x - a)

1. Note that u-sub doesn't work.
2. Note the two factors (x+2) and (x-2)

3.  We basically "decompose" or split the term into two terms, each with their own factor. However, this only works if they can combine back to the same original term. What does this mean?

4. We multiply the A term with the denominator of the B term. Likewise, we do the vice versa for the B term. Set the A and B equal to the numerator of the original term.
	1. Why? Because in order to add two fractions, we need to get like terms. This requires multiplying both the denominator and the numerator with the same value. Remember that the individual partial fractions need to be able to combine into the original whole fraction. 

5. Now, we solve for "A" and "B". We do this by setting "x" to a value where it cancels one term. (If we want to solve for A, we would set x = -2 to cancel out B).

Now we just solve! Yippie!

Note that this method also works with more than two factors:

Note that if the original term is an improper rational expression (higher degree in numerator OR same degree in both numerator and denominator), we will need to divide to simplify.

Synthesis Division

1. When the denominator is just a single factor, synthesis division can be used. It is very efficient.
2. Note that after dividing, you end up with a polynomial + a proper fraction. You know how to integrate these!

Long Division

1. Note that the denominator is more than just a single factor. This is where we use long division.
2. Note that after dividing, there is a binomial, and then a cheeky little proper fraction (that we will need to use partial fractions in order to integrate).
