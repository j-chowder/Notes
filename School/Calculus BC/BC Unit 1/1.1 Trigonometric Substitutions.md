##### Inverse Trigonometric Functions

These questions are pretty straightforward. Just try and exercise pattern recognition:

1. If there is shiz in the denominator without any way of u-substituting anything out, see if it can become an arctan function. 
2. If there is a nasty radical in the denominator with (1) a constant MINUS (2) an even power on the variable, then see if that can become an arcsine function. 


You will sometimes have to "complete the square" to rewrite the denominator into something that can fit into the inverse trig functions.

This one is relatively simple. 

1. To determine what the factor (x + a) is, identify the "b" of x$^2$ + bx + c.
	1. a = b/2
2. To determine what the "c" is before we do simplify, it is (b/2)$^2$. 
	1. e.g. (12/2)$^2$ = 36.

 This one is trickier. Biggest thing is knowing that u-substitution is impossible in this problem. (And that Integration by Parts and Partial Fractions also do not work).

1. We factor out the negative from x$^2$ and 4x so that we can eventually turn it into the arcsin form. Then we complete the square.

2. Note that when we did complete the square, the 4 in the parenthesis is "added" - but remember that we factored out the negative already. Thus, we are technically subtracting the 4 in the parenthesis. Which explains why the 4 on the outside is added.

2. Note that when we factored out the negative in step 1, 21 is not negative. We didn't factor out the negative from the entire denominator - we only rearranged it so that we can make a perfect square.

##### Trigonometric Identities

This content isn't really anything new. However, there are patterns in solving trigonometric integrals that are a bit more complex than ones we see in AB. These "guidelines" allow you to basically braindead these problems instead of having to treat it like an AMC question.

Seeing only trig functions (with powers greater than 1) indicates that you probably have to do this shiz.

###### Guidelines for integrals involving ==products of sine and cosine.==

###### Sine

if the power of sine is an odd integer, save one sine off to the side, and turn sin$^2$x into (1 - cos$^2$x).
* we save one sine so that when we u-sub cosx later, du will eat it up.

So the form ends up being ( 1- cos$^2$x)cos$^n$xsinx.

Now substitute u = cosx and solve.

##### Cosine

*Same thing as Sine, instead we flip it*.

If the power of cosine is an odd integer, split one cosine off, and turn cos$^2$x into (1 - sin$^2$x).

So the form ends up being sin$^n$x(1 - sin$^2$x)$^k$ cosx

Then substitute u = sinx and solve.

*Note that if both sine and cosine are odd, either strategy can be used.*

If both cosine and sine are even, though, you will need to use half-angle identities.
* Why? Because we need an odd number so that (1) we can split one off so that when we u-sub, it will be eaten up and (2) we need the remaining even number so that we can use the Pythagorean identity cos$^2$x + sin$^2$x = 1.

##### Guidelines for products of Tangent and Secant

Biggest thing: Remember that for secant, the power has to be **even**. 
* Why? Because when you u-sub tanx, its derivative is sec$^2$x. You need to hold a sec$^2$x to be eaten up.

##### Trigonometric Substitution

When do you use trig sub?

1. Basically whenever it looks like you can do inverse trig but you actually can't. Biggest tell is whenever there is the radical function with a$^2$ and x$^2$. 
	1. i.e. the expression is in the numerator and there is shiz in the denominator, preventing you from being able to just u-sub.
	2. There's lots of doodoo in the denominator.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcwktBLL_urOI0o9VWXPDohj9YTjGcv7x1B4Ty1T5IHVR0gRDN3R9mP8PB1yoC52oJj1hkgApq5TT4rVNnWSvo3X_Sqa2HoXrM4eI4LhqxNCRu9-hLqrRZ3NMB-eTw5iAnbkq2TEtTLUwe4HEDrjZvU1H4?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

So you see this shiz. What is the first thing you do?

1. So you will have to memorize the table - and just sub in "x" with the equation. We will need to take the dx of it as well because we are basically making the entire integral into a respect of θ.
2. The triangle is used at the very end; but to generate the triangle, we have to utilize the x= trig equation.
	1. solve the x = 3sinθ for θ. It would then be θ = sin$^-$$^1$(x/3).
	2. Then, to actually label the triangle, (always have the right angle on the right - then θ will always be in the left corner), think in triangular trigonometry. Soh Cah Toa.
		1. In this example, sin is used. So, "x" is opposite and "3" is hypotenuse. Then Pythagorean Theorem is used to find the last value.

Sub the x and the dx in the original integrand with the values we defined in the previous steps.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd5UT4sj45EHaKz0Viqt1i7douhkEEfEIPKJ6WG0539mcsCLTY6o1RencUuZR187ZMpFz23iP8k4-Q3lt6dGm9CqITlR3pot1mfKMuPQS7drYlNewhormFe0HOSo74ZQmQKXadvDHxEfACZyhr-R0-ClK2s?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

The 9s in the radical was able to be extracted to a 3. Alongside the 3 in cosine, we completely cancel out the coefficients in both the numerator and denominator.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeecZmjS8O3AZtzdSJeRYEuL5feIyCQsUChCdK7YpnV0gr2YjrE3HnsCLFEmqnALVCRKVYYyHBxpWb9vAB81uvRK7trRuCW4PVw4bOmkcCEIiKDd5LucwsGwZborCaC1Oe-kf4xKCnxncL14n1s8n3d508W?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

The (1 - sin$^2$θ) is a Pythagorean identity that turns into cos$^2$θ. With the radical, it simply becomes cosθ. 

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe8vCLmdCwxfs_72gyEv8iyatDvUb0xYqieEr2x2X1MpClrrJwx7uKkknvEM95gZY-iddNK1vAZqIh6WnHrxsHui_jfy45QKeFyoH63qmrXlajnmF10TjhIWj6JsMpFv-NUrjV7CFUsg4bhvo-NuNPGpP3u?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

Simple enough. Remember though, that we're not done yet. We now need to replace the θ back with x.

Here is where we use the triangle.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeGWp3uP9ZRQIoMdClfUFY8s_XO7VIr1uTNrxZGCwWRAuAqJtbuZAkpCCriOCK1w6K4axcxFrWHSSDVNi5jTAr69YsYxLJOBRYbDMJWcLc-XSXsTgLh-CtX1smYOJu3X55hbkxZn7p2tRjJ9Fwm7EYMCwk?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

So long as you know "soh cah toa", the other ones are easy - they're just the opposites. So cotθ would be "adjacent/opposite".

θ is just subbed back in with what we defined in step 2.

---

So, that was just one example, and the problems can vary **a lot.** But, there are some general guidelines that are valuable in every problem:

1. identify the expression and how to substitute x with trig. Label the triangle.
2. Get the dx.
3. Substitute the x and dx in the original integrand with all the trig stuff.
4. Simplify everything - simplify the expression in the radical with the goal of canceling things in the numerator and denominator out. Use Pythagorean identities. 
5. Now it should be integrate-able; integrate it.
6. Replace θ with x; reference the triangle when dealing with (trig)θ terms.
