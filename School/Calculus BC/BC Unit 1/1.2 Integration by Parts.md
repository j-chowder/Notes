Just like how u-sub is the integral variant of the chain rule, integration by parts is the integral variant of the product rule.


1. Determine what your "u" and "dv" is. There are only two choices.

	* There is an order of operations to decide which term should be the "u".
		* Logarithmic, inverse trig, algebraic, trigonometric, exponential --> in that order.

2. Then, differentiate "u" to get du. Integrate "dv" to get v.

Now we assemble:

## ∫udv = `uv - ∫vdu`

( There is a logical explanation / proof behind this, but I don't care)

This is an example where we would want to use u-sub since it'll make the problem much easier (but because we already have a "u", we use "w").

1. Note that little trick with the radical - we instead just square both values to make it easier to work with THEN we differentiate.
2. We substitute 2wdw into the function, then we proceed as normal to find our "u" and "dv".
3. Just remember to resubstitute x back into the equation.

Yes, we can use the "u-dv" method, and admittedly, sometimes we have to - or sometimes it is just the easiest method. However, this alternate method is quote unquote "INTEGRATION BY PARTS DOESNT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE LITTLE TRICK!!!!!!"

##### Tabular Method
*  I'm pretty sure you can only do tabular with (1) algebraic and (2) sine and cosine as "u". Martinez doesn't say shiz though.

1. So same thing at the beginning. Identify the "u" and "dv" with the order of operations.
2. Then differentiate the "u" until you reach 0.
3. Integrate the "dv" the same amount of times.
4. Follow the arrow and multiply the values (at a diagonal). The signs alternate so be aware of that as well. Note that the first line always starts positive.

Note that I said differentiate the "u" until you reach 0. But that only applies to algebraic terms.

For trigonometric terms:

1. Differentiate until the trig cycles back to the original (sign doesn't matter.)
2. We still integrate normally and we still stop where the differentiation stopped.
3. We still do diagonal, BUT for the last line, we multiply to the right. Since we couldn't make it zero, we will still have to take the integral of those terms.
	1. Or do we?! Arf arf arf! Note (the circles in blue) that that new integral is the same as the one we started with originally. Thus, even if we try to integrate, it will just keep going on infinitely.
	2. We can, however, just algebraically deal with those terms and move that integral to the other side - making it 2∫e$^x$cosxdx.
	3. Then we divide that 2 to the rest of the antiderivative and that is our answer.
