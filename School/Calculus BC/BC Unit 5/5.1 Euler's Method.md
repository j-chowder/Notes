*Often, differential equations are not easy to solve -- many of them are impossible to solve using analytical methods. Euler's Method is a numerical method to approximate the solution to a differential equation.*

> Euler's method is a tool to "simulate" the differential equation because those equations often can't be solved analytically. 

>"Euler's method is basically a tangent line approximation but with course correction."

In essence,

Given a point (x$_o$, y$_o$) and `dy/dx`, we can find the slope of a tangent line for that point. Then, we assume that slope is fixed until the next x, x$_1$ and use that assumption to estimate what the next y, y$_1$ would be. We then use this new point (x$_1$ , y$_1$) to determine a new `dy/dx`. Rinse and repeat.

##### Step Size
* step size is simply the increments in which you change x (the independent variable). It is Δx -- the change in x.
* The smaller the Δx, the more accurate the approximation will be to the actual solution: it is more frequently altering the `dy/dx` to properly reflect the change in slope of the actual curve.
* 'amount of steps' is simply (ending position - starting position) / (step size).
	* i.e. 
		* You want to approximate f(1.5) and you are given (1, 1). The step size is Δx = 0.1
		* amount of steps = (1.5 - 1) / (0.1) = 4 steps.

#### Actually doing this stuff.

* Since we are given the Δx, this will be used to calculate the Δy.
	* Using `dy/dx = k`, we can isolate `dy` (which is Δy) to calculate the change in y for the given change in x: `dy = k * dx`

* As a formula: y$_n$$_+$$_1$ = y$_n$ + hf'(x)$_n$ 
	* or: y$_n$$_+$$_1$ = y$_n$ + dy
		* the new y is just the previous y + the change in y.

* I think it is important to emphasize that we are 
	* using the **previous points'** x, y, and dy/dx **to estimate a new y.** We are using the equation that applied to the previous tangent line to now solve for a new y after a set Δx.
