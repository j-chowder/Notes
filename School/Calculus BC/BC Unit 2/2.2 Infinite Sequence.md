### Tips for deriving sequences

* treat the numerator and the denominator as two different things. Isolate them and try to identify the pattern of each --> then combine.
* Find the pattern first then finish deriving by seeing what evaluates to a$_1$ 
* If the signs alternate, (-1)$^n$ is present.
* if consecutive terms are changing via constant multiplication (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) -- then it will be (r)$^n$ (where r is the multiplier -- in this case, 2).
* if consecutive terms are changing via constant addition (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) -- then it will be (r)n (where r is what the change between each is -- in this case, 2).
* if the sequence only cycles, especially if through `[-1, 1]` then it is probably a trigonometric function.
### Limits of a Sequence

Trying to find the limit of a sequence  -- determining whether or not that sequence will converge (have a finite limit) or diverge (no limit, limit = DNE).

Basically:

Evaluating the limit -- as n goes to infinity -- of a sequence.

* Everything we learned in the previous lesson [[2.1 L'Hôpital's Rule]] is relevant and can be applied.

##### Bounded Monotonic Sequences

`monotonicity` or a `monotonic function` is a function where terms are [[Monotonic]] -- TLDR is if every consecutive term is either (1) nondecreasing or (2) nonincreasing.

1. nondecreasing means never decreasing -- can be constant or increase.
2. nonincreasing means never increasing -- can be constant or decrease. 

Likewise, a `monotonic sequence` is a sequence that is monotonic.

##### Bounded

Basically horizontal asymptotes.

* A sequence is `bounded above` by a number M, if M is **greater than** every term in the sequence.
* A sequence is `bounded below` by a number N, if N is **less than** every term in the sequence.
* A sequence is `bounded` if it has both above and below.
	* Note that if a sequence is monotonic, right above or right below the **first term** will have a bound (because it is in the extreme of being the largest or smallest term).

Overall:
If a sequence is both `monotonic` and `bounded`, then it is `convergent`. The sequence thus converges at the horizontal asymptote that it approaches as n proceeds to infinity.

If either requirement is not met, then the sequence is overall `divergent`.

`if(sequence == monotonic && sequence == bounded)`
`   return convergent;`
`else`
`  return divergent;`

A.) Bounded and monotonic (nonincreasing) --> converges to 0.

B.) Bounded and monotonic (nondecreasing) --> converges to 6.

C.) Bounded but not monotonic --> divergent.

D.) Not bounded (no bound above) but monotonic --> divergent.

##### Determining whether a sequence is monotonic.

Above, we were able to determine if the sequence was monotonic simply by looking at the graph. However, we now need to determine monotonicity from just the actual sequence.

1. Basically: try out the first few terms of the sequence.
2. If it looks to be monotonic -- nondecreasing/increasing -- then you have to show a  "proof." Otherwise, you can just say "not monotonic."
3. To prove, you have to set up an inequality where (first term) (inequality) (second term).
	* 1st term = the original sequence
	* 2nd term = the succeeding term (sub in n+1 for every n)
	* inequality depends on whether the sequence seems to be nondecreasing or nonincreasing.
		* if nondecreasing, (first term) ≤ (second term) -- since the succeeding term should always equal or be greater than the preceding term.
		* if nonincreasing, (first term) ≥ (second term) -- since the succeeding term should always be equal or be less than the preceding term. 
* Once you set up the inequality, cross multiply.
	* Note that the cross multiplication goes from denominator to numerator -- so (left numerator ⋅ right denominator) --> inequality --> (right numerator ⋅ left denominator) in order from left to right.

(a) In the case that the sequence is clearly not "nondecreasing" or "nonincreasing," we can just straight up say "not monotonic." We showed a counterexample that proved the sequence is not monotonic, so we good.

(b) It looks like it's increasing (nondecreasing). Set up and solve.

* you can ignore (-1)$^n$ and still find the limit of the sequence (must equal 0)
	* if you do this and the limit does not equal 0, then the limit does not exist. It oscillates.
