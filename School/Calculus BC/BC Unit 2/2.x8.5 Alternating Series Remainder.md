Used to estimate the sum of an alternate infinite series (to make the first 2 decimals places certain)

In order to perform the alternate series remainder, the alternate series must **converge** (naturally).  Which was discussed in the previous lesson.

The difference between the infinite sum (S) and the partial sum (S$_n$) is the remainder (R$_n$).
Conversely, the remainder R$_n$ + the partial sum S$_n$ = the infinite sum S.

The "**remainder**" is a vague generalization for "everything after the partial sum"

So, if we figure out the "bounds" of the remainder, we can find the bounds on the actual sum.

The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem states that: the remainder R$_n$ ≤ a$_n$$_+$$_1$ . 

By using that inequality, we can figure out what the maximum value R$_n$ can be (by solving for a$_n$$_+$$_1$)

So, if we know what the maximum value of the remainder can be (aka the error), we can set up:

(S$_n$ - a$_n$$_+$$_1$)  < S < (S$_n$ + a$_n$$_+$$_1$)

The infinite sum will be GREATER than partial sum - the error and SMALLER than the partial sum + the error. 
* because the error is the MAXIMUM value of what the remainder can be. 

##### To find the number of terms to approx. the sum of series with an error of less than 0.001

That means that for R$_n$ ≤ a$_n$$_+$$_1$ ,
the remainder should be set to 0.001. Solve for n.
