Partial sums are the sum of a specific, limited number of terms from a sequence. 

* We basically taking a "part" of the entire series, rather than adding up every term in an infinite sequence.

`S` is the series -- the infinite summation of the sequence a$_n$. 

S$_6$ is the partial sum of the first 6 terms.

S$_3$ is the partial sum of the first 3 terms -- 49/36.
