Big Idea: 

∞ - ∞ ≠ 0. ∞ is just a concept without any actual boundaries and/or restrictions as to what it can be, and what it can't be. It's ultimately ambiguous. 

Take this example:

You have infinite integers (∞$_1$).  
And you have a second "value," which is every odd integer (∞$_2$)

Now, if you remove an infinite amount of odd integers from an infinite amount of integers as a whole, what remains?  (∞$_1$ - ∞$_2$ = ?) The remaining values are **all even integers** which, like ∞$_2$, is also an infinite quantity. 

Basically: you can't interact with infinity like how you would with tangible, algebraic concepts and numbers.

#####  L'Hôpital's Rule

We have already gone over the standard L'Hôpital's Rule with taking a limit of a fraction -- where the limit of both the numerator and denominator equal 0 or ∞ (aka indeterminate form).

Now we will go over alternate forms that can be indeterminate.

#### Limits of Products

- Since L'Hôpital only works on fractions, we want to convert a product into a quotient. We do this by dividing one function by 1/(the other function). 
	- Remember that when dividing by 1/f(x), you are really just multiplying by f(x). Nothing changes from the original problem - we are just altering it so that we can use L'Hôpital.


#### Limits of a difference

- Again, the goal is to try and convert the original problem into a **singular fraction.** This will mean that you might need to:
	- get like-terms and then combine
	- convert trig functions


#### Limits of exponents

* Use ln to turn the exponential form into product form.
* Then it's pretty much the limits of products.
	* remember after to turn ln(y) back into y.
