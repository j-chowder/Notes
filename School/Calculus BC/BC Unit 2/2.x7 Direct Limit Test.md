Basically the same thing as [[2.x6 Direct Comparison Test]] . But, instead of comparing which series is bigger and all that shiz, you can just take the limit of a$_n$ / b$_n$ (first series / second series).

If that limit is greater than 0 and not infinity, (0 < L < âˆž) then the original series will be the same as the second series. If b$_n$ is convergent, then a$_n$ is convergent. If b$_n$ is divergent then a$_n$ is divergent.

Same tips as DCT.
