* Since we are working with a geometric sequence, we will always be multiplying the first term of the series "a" by some "r" to the nth power.
* identify the pattern; in this case, we are multiplying by (1/3) each time. r = (1/3)

1. Biggest thing is: identify the pattern -- identify "r" and "a".
	* a is a$_1$ in every scenario. If the series is n = 0, then a$_1$ is already given. If the series is n = 1, then a$_1$ must be solved for -- by plugging in n = 1.
	
2. If | r | < 1, the partial sum that the series converges to will be (a) / ( 1- r )
	
3. if | r | â‰¥ 1. the geometric series diverges.

`if( Math.abs(r) < 1)`
` return "convergent, now use the formula";`
`else`
` return "divergent";`

Note that finding the limit of a series as n approaches infinity = what number you get closer and closer to when you add up more and more terms of the sequence.

This limit of this geometric series is 1 because as you keep adding each successive term, you get closer and closer to 1. As you go to infinity, the sum will approach 1. 

1/2 + 1/4 = .75

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = .875

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = .9375

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 = .96875

... etc.

This is why | r | must be < 1 -- if it were greater than 1, each successive term being added will be larger (rather than smaller) than the preceding term. So naturally the sum will get larger and larger -- infinitely larger. 

By having each successive term get smaller than the previous, the sum will change less and less -- as it approaches infinity, the sum will continue to get infinitely closer to a certain value. Hence it "converges" at that value.
