Sometimes limits can be evaluated by determining relative growth rates of the numerator and denominator.

What is relative growth rate?

* how fast a function grows as x gets "sufficiently large."
	* this is relative, so "fast" depends on the other functions in the term.
	* "sufficiently large" is important because some functions start slow and then build up faster and faster. x$^3$ >> e$^x$ for x = 2, but that does not mean x$^3$ is faster than e$^x$ . 

* `y = 3` < `y = lnx` < `y = x` < `y = x^2` < `y = x^8` < `y = e^x`
	* I am pretty sure x$^a$ will always be slower than e$^x$, for any number a.

	* visualize (or actually graph) these functions and see how y grows as x grows. That is the "growth rate". The steeper the slope, the faster the growth rate.

* In the case that f(x) >> g(x), as x --> ∞, f(x) will get increasingly (infinitively) larger than g(x). So it will be ∞.

* In the case that f(x) << g(x), as x --> ∞, g(x) will get increasingly (infinitively) larger than f(x). so it will be (constant)/∞ = 0. 

Solving limits using relative growth rates is required with terms that contain factorials. (since we can't LH/derive it)
