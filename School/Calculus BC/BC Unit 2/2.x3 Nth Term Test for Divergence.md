**Relationship between a sequence and its series:**
* When a sequence converges to zero, each succeeding term a$_n$$_+$$_1$  is smaller than the preceding term, a$_n$. Since it infinitely gets smaller, the limit -- as n approaches infinity -- is zero.
* If a sequence, instead, gets larger every succeeding term, the limit will be infinity, thus diverging.
* The series reflects the sequence: since summation occurs, the series can only converge if the sequence converges to zero. If the sequence increasingly gets larger, the series will approach infinity instead.

* Note that if the lim of a$_n$ = 0, though, that tells nothing about whether or not its series converges or diverges. If it does equal 0, another test must be done to properly decide.

Because the limit of a$_n$ does not equal 0, the series is thus divergent. Why? Because the series is the summation of the sequence -- the sequence is 2/3 when n is very large. If you tried to calculate the sum of the sequence, (thus the series), for an **infinite number of terms,** 2/3 will be infinitely added when approaching infinity. 

Since the sum keeps on getting bigger and bigger, it becomes infinity and thus the limit of the series is divergent. The series does not converge to a **finite value.**
