An alternating series is a series that **alternates** in sign. 

It is characteristic in the form (-1)$^n$ a$_n$ (where each odd term is negative) or the form (-1)$^n$$^-$ $^1$ 
(where each even term is negative).

Note, though, that you never involve the (-1)$^n$ and just only deal with the a$_n$ to the side.

1.
You determine if a$_n$ > 0 by reasoning if any term will turn negative from `[k, ∞]` where k is the value that the series starts at. (n = k). This shouldn't be too hard.
* be wary of trig functions
* note that factorials by themselves will not be negative.


2.
Note that the alternating series test strictly tests convergence. 

If the limit to infinity ≠ 0, then it will automatically be divergent. BUT, that is due to the **Nth Term Test** NOT because of the Alternating series test. * important for MCQ, or when you need to actually name the test you used.  
([[2.x3 Nth Term Test for Divergence]])

3.
So "Midtinez" wants us to do the "proof" thingy like what we did to prove monotonicity with sequences. Refer back if necessary.

But, Organic Chemistry Teacher just takes the derivative of a$_n$ to see if it is decreasing. (finding critical points + number line)

Though a$_n$ increases from `[1, e)`, it decreases from `[e, ∞)`. "In the long run, it is a decreasing sequence." 

So, a$_n$$_-$$_1$ <= a$_n$ in the long run and so everything is fine and we are gay! (cheerful!)

Note that though there is no (-1)$^n$, the cos(nπ)/n function is exactly the same as the (-1)$^n$ 1/n function.

The cos(nπ) is simply to create the alternating series effect. It is a cheeky little "variation" of (-1)$^n$. So just treat it like (-1)$^n$ and ignore the cos.
