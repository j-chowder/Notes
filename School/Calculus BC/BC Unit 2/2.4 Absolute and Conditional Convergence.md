This is relevant for series that involve negatives -- primarily alternating series. 

Simply put:

Note that if | S$_n$ | is converges, then the series as a whole is considered **absolutely convergent** -- and thus convergent. Checking the original series is not needed.

But, if | S$_n$ | diverges, we need to check the original series to determine if (1) divergent or (2) conditionally convergent.

if the alternating series converges BUT | S$_n$ | diverges, then the series as a whole is considered **conditionally convergent.**

If both diverge, then the series is considered **divergent.**
* Aksulsahhhlyyy, if S$_n$ diverges then it diverges. (I'm pretty sure if S$_n$ diverges then | S$_n$ | has to diverge as well)

Note that | S$_n$ | is just S$_n$ without the negative shiz:

e.g.

S$_n$ = (-1)$^n$ $^+$ $^1$ / n$^2$ 

| S$_n$ | = 1/n$^2$ 

---
This is particularly useful for series that involve negative terms, BUT is not an alternating series.

i.e. this one switches signs every 2 numbers.

* If we can determine | S$_n$ | to be convergent, then the S$_n$ is absolutely convergent and thus converges.
