*the integral test for convergence is a method used to test infinite series of **monotonic** terms for convergence.*

Bottom line:

You must know:
1. Integral test can only be used if f 
	* is continuous 
	* positive
	* decreasing
	in the interval `[k, ∞)`
2. if ∫(k, ∞) f(x)dx converges, then ∑(n=k) f(x) converges.
3. if ∫(k, ∞) f(x)dx diverges, then ∑(n=k) f(x) diverges.

When to use:
1. f(x) is easy to integrate
2. If you can use a calculator
3. If you're told you have to. 

* You might have to use f'(x) to show that the function is actually decreasing. 
	* f'(x) < 0 for x >= k
		* use number line, find critical value, etc. if needed.

* Note the summation of a function (aka the series) is really just taking Right Riemann squares of the curve.

* Instead of just estimating the area under the curve, if we able to accurately evaluate the **complete area under the curve** as it goes to infinity (which is just taking the integral from 1 to infinity), we are then able
	* find the upper bound of the function 
	* and therefore determine what the function converges to (or if it just diverges).

To find the upper bound:
* We can rewrite ∑(n=1) 1/n$^2$ as ( 1 + ∑(n=2) 1/n$^2$)
	* since the first term (n=1) is just 1.
* Then, since we know that (1) the series of the function is just taking the Right Riemann squares under the curve and (2) integral test can only be done on a decreasing function, it is thus known that ( 1 + ∑(n=2) 1/n$^2$) is an **underestimation** of the area under the curve. 
* Since it is an underestimation, it will be **less than** the integral (the actual area under the curve). That is how we set up the inequality.
	* We needed to rewrite the original series to match the same form as the (1 + integral) -- since the integral is just f(1) + ∫(1, ∞) f(x)dx.  f(1) must be there to connect the lower bound of the integral.
		
Once solved:

Since we now know that the function has an upper bound and a lower bound, and that the function is monotonic (nonincreasing), we can conclude that the series is convergent.

Another explanation of when divergent:

In this case, the summation was left-Riemann sums. So, if the integral goes to infinity, the overestimation (therefore greater than the integral) must also go to infinity.
