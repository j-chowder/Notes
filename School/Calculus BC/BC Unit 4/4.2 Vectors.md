*What is a vector?*

> a quantity that has a magnitude (size) and direction. It is represented by an arrow inside a coordinate system -- like the xy plane -- where the tail sits at the origin.

*What is a vector-valued function?*

> r(t) = <f(t), g(t)> where f(t) and g(t) are component functions of the vector r(t). For the xy Cartesian coordinate system, f(t) represents the x function and g(t) represents the y function.

**Working with vector functions**

``Deriving x and y functions from a vector equation r(t)``

Since r(t) = <f(t), g(t)> and since x = f(t) and y = g(t), 

the x function will be f(t) 
and
the y function will be g(t).

``Domain of a vector equation r(t)``

The domain of r(t) is found from the **intersection of the domains of its components.** A parametric value where f(t) or g(t) is undefined will make r(t) undefined as well.

``Graphing a vector-valued function on a xy plane``

You can:

1. Make a table and plug in values for the parametric variable, solving for each component.

2. Completely eliminate the parametric variable by either doing 
	* substitution
	* trig identities, like pythagorean.

To find the direction, plug in ascending values for the parametric value and the corresponding (x, y) value will show up.
* i.e. t = 0, t = 1, t = 2 will give you the chronological order and thus direction of the motion.

`Addition and Subtraction`

Addition (and subtraction, they are exactly the same) is just adding the individual components of multiple vectors together.

> →A + →B = <(add i components of both), (add j components of both)>

``Scalar Multiplication``

Scalar Multiplication is just extending (if k > 1) or shrinking (if k < 1) the vector. 
* multiplying a vector by 2 means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as the original.
* multiplying a vector by 1/3 means you squish that vector down so that it's one third the original length.
* multiplying by a negative number means the vector gets flipped around, then stretched/shirked by the factor.

Just multiply each of the components by the factor/scalar. 

>2r(t) = <(2 · i component), (2 · j component)>

``Dot product``

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdz7IXYwktW7hN94sEr20wMdh7-LbB2bbbQfUfurfz9w5bJz9m4PonQLIf6gCPriGI0dNcHOTM8jTvLnVkpYtBkWLm8sZHlEsK4HFljW6ccraYAAjJ173D21Kwl87GbchzZv9hcaQ?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

It is important to note that dot product is a `scalar` value. Which means we do not denote the dot product with <> or `i, j` notation.

``Limits and Derivatives``

>Again, the limit and derivative of a vector-valued function r(t) is defined by the individual limits and derivatives of its components. 

Note that all limit and derivative methods/tricks we have learned still apply (like l'hospital's, power rule, etc.)

``Continuity``

Just like the domain, the continuity of a vector is the overlapping continuities of its components.

#### Derivative and Integration Rules

``Differential Equations``

i.e. going from r'(t) to r(t).

The only difference between normal differential equations with a normal function versus a vector function is that 

* we integrate both components
* each component will have a distinct c -- c$_k$

#### Velocity and Acceleration

lowkey physics, this shiz is easy af.

Note the velocity and acceleration **vectors**. Their direction and magnitude should make sense accordingly with the position curve. 

``Clarification``

The vector v(t) describes the rate of change of the vector r(t) -- position. It **is not the slope of a line tangent to the path of the particle.** 

The slope of the line is the derivative of how y changes with respect to x: dy/dx, because we are plotting the points on a xy cartesian plane.

Luckily, dy/dx is related to v(t): since v(t) can be expressed as <x'(t), y'(t)>, we can just take the y'(t) and divide it by the x'(t) to obtain our dy/dx.

#### Projectile Motion

*The path of a projectile launched from an initial height h and an angle of elevation θ is described by the vector function:*

the x position component is just initial x velocity · time. 

the y position component is 
* initial height + 
* initial y velocity · time
* -0.5gt$^2$ (to account for gravity pulling it back to the ground)
