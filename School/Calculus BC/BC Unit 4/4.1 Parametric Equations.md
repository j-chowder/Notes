*a parametric equation is an equation where the variables (usually x and y) are expressed in terms of a third parameter, usually expressed as t.*

Basically:

1. Find the derivative of y with respect to t: `dy/dt`
2. Find the derivative of x with respect to t: `dx/dt`
3. Then divide the `dy/dt` with `dx/dt` to get `dy/dx`

Then:

To get `d2y/dx2`
1. Take the derivative of `dy/dx` with respect to t: `d/dt [ dy/dx ]`
2. divide by `dx/dt`

To get `d3y/dx3`
1. Take the derivative of `d2y/dx2` with respect to t: `d/dt [ d2y/dx2 ]`
2. divide by `dx/dt`

**Finding tangent lines of parametric equations.** 

`Case 1: point (a, b) is given. Find (multiple) tangent equations.`

We have the x-value and y-value given -- but we need the t-value to find the m-value (slope) at that point to determine the equation. 

So you solve for t with the individual equations x(t) and y(t) with the respective `a` and `b`. 
* In solving for the t-value, remember that it must be applicable to **both** the x and the y. 

Plug the t-value into the dy/dx equation to get your `m`. 

Use the point slope formula: `y - y1 = m(x - x1)` to get your equations to the tangent lines.

* Note that in this example x(t) and y(t) were given and used to solve for dy/dx.

`Case 2: Parametric variable is given. Find tangent equations at point (x, y).`

Just plug in the parametric variable into your dy/dx to get m. 

To get the point (x, y) plug the parametric variable into their respective parametric equations. Then use point-slope form. 
* i.e. x(t) & y(Î¸).

#### Horizontal and Vertical Tangents.

Remember that horizontal tangents are when `dy/dx = 0` and vertical tangents are when `dy/dx = undefined`

So, because `dy/dx` = `dy/dt` / `dx/dt`, horizontal tangents are found where `dy/dt` = 0 and vertical tangents are found where `dx/dt` = 0.
* (Or horizontal = when numerator = 0. Vertical = when denominator = 0).

Again, once you have the parametric value(s) of tangency, you plug into the x(t) and y(t) to find the (x, y) point.

#### Concavity

Remember that concavity is determined from the second derivative of the function, so `d2y/dx2`. 

To determine intervals on which the curve is concave up/down, 

1. Find critical values from setting `d2y/dx2 = 0`. 
2. Plot on the line, test values in between critical values with the second derivative. 

To determine if "the tangent line overestimates or underestimates the curve", solve for `d2y/dx2` at the parametric value. 

If `d2y/dx2 > 0`, then the curve is in an interval that is concave up -- so that tangent line will understimate.

If `d2y/dx2 < 0` then the curve is in an interval that is concave down -- so that tangent line will overestimate.

#### Speed & Arc Length

I think this is pretty intuitive. Total speed is just the vector of its x and y speed components.

To find the distance traveled (displacement):

Recall that for a curve, the distance traveled can also be considered the arc length of the curve.

#### Speed Applications

`Particle's position (x,y) at time, t = b`

> You must be given the "reference point" of the position of the particle at a certain initial t = a.

1. Solve for the x-position: `x(b) = x(a) + integral from a to b (x'(t))dt`
2. Solve for the y-position: `y(b) = y(a) + integral from a to b (y('t))dt`
3. Combine.

`Is (horizontal) movement of the particle to the left or the right at time, t = k`

Use dx/dt and solve at t = k. 

If x'(k) > 0 then x(k) has a positive slope -- it is increasing. So it is moving to the right horizontally.

If x'(k) < 0 then x(k) has a negative slope -- it is decreasing. So it is moving to the left horizontally.

> Note that I say `slope` but remember that these are parametric equations. Think of it more as "how is x changing in respect to t" rather than "the slope". x is increasing as t increases, or x is decreasing as t increases.

`General tips`

This shiz is quite easy. The only way to make these questions more tricky is to make it harder to get the x'(t) and the y'(t). 
* graph of x(t) versus t (using graph to find slope at t = k)
* having a table of t, f(t), f'(t)
* etc.

Just know that 
1. You need x'(t) and y'(t) to get | v(t) |, direction of motion, position of particle, slope of the tangent line. Basically: whenever the (x, y) is actually relevant.
2. You need | v(t) | to get arc length and distance traveled. Basically: whenever the particle's overall motion versus t is relevant.

> Difference between 'position of particle' and 'distance traveled'.

* Position of particle = in respect to (x, y).
* Distance traveled = displacement. Integral of velocity/speed.
