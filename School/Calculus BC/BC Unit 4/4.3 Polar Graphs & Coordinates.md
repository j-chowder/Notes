### Drawing Polar Graphs

`General Tips`
* Imagine the entire coordinate system as a unit circle -- the θ is what determines in what direction your curve goes. (i.e.  = π will go along the negative x-axis)
	* Then, once you have determined the direction, `r` is the length of how far the curve goes.
* since `r` is a vector, being negative just means it goes the complete opposite direction.
	* (2, π) is the same as (-2, 0).
	* (-3, π/2) is the same as (3, 3π/2)

`Rose Curves`
(in the form r = acos(nθ) or asin(nθ)).

Since rose curves always travel from the origin --> tip of the petal --> back to the origin, the easiest way to draw these curves is to just:

solve the function for where it reaches the tip of the petal. (since the max value sinθ and cosθ can be is 1, the max value will be `a` and where θ makes sin or cos = 1)
i.e. r= = 2sin3θ. Solve sin3θ = 1. θ = π/6, 3π/6, 5π/6, etc. 
* Repeat for `n` times if `nθ` is odd.
* Repeat for `2n` times if `nθ` is even
	* Since the rose has to be symmetrical, you can rawdog after a certain point.

`Circles`
(in the form r = acosθ, asinθ, a) --> the base of the angle is just θ.

r = a
* Circle that is centered around the pole.
* the radius is the `a`.
r = `acosθ`
* Circle that is revolved around the x-axis.
	* if `a` > 0, then to the right of the y-axis.
	* if `a` < 0, then to the left of the y-axis.
* The diameter is `a` and the radius is `0.5a`. So the center is also where `0.5a`
`r = asinθ`
* Circle that is revolved around the y-axis.
	* if `a` > 0, then above the x-axis.
	* if `a` < 0, then below the x-axis.
* The diameter is `a` and the radius is `0.5a`. So the center is also where `0.5a`

``Limacons``
(in the form `r = a ± bcosθ` or `r = a ± bsinθ`) -- (a > 0, b > 0)

For all limacons, if `a + bcosθ`, revolves around the x-axis, to the right of the y-axis. If `a - bcosθ`, then to the left of the y-axis.

if `a + bsinθ`, revolves around the y-axis, above the x-axis. If `a - bsinθ`, then below the y-axis.

where a/b < 1
* Limacon with inner loop.
* Regardless of form, the `inner loop` will be the one closer to the pole, and the `outer loop` will be the one farther from the pole.
	* The intercepts of the inner loop and outer loop have the `r` of a ± b. Again, bigger one = outer loop.
* Assume r = 2 - 3cosθ.
	* Lies on the left side of the y-axis.
	* Inner loop is formed on the x-intercepts found on x = -1 and x = 0.
	* Outer loop is formed on the x-intercept found on x = -5 AND the y-intercepts found on y = 2 and y = -2.
		* I found the y-intercepts where cosθ = 0, so π/2 and 3π/2. Note how these radians perfectly align with the y-axis.

* I.e. `r = 1 -3sinθ`
	1. Since it is `a - bsinθ`, I know it will revolve (1) around the y-axis and (2) be below the x-axis.
	2. I identify the y-intercepts that define where the inner loop and outer loop end.
		1. a + b  = -2. 
		2. a - b = 4.
		3. Since | a + b | < | a - b |,  I know that r = 2 is where the inner loop ends and that r = 4 is where the outer loop ends.
	3. I identify the x-intercepts. r = -1 and r = 1.
	4. Now I draw the curve.

where a/b = 1
* Cardioid (heart-shaped mf)

1. Determine the direction, and position of the cardioid.
2. Do a + b and a - b. One of them will equal 0. The other one will be the end of the outer (and in this case, only) loop. 
3. Find the intercepts that define the breadth of the cardioid, defined by `a`. 
4. Draw the mfing curve.

where 1 < a/b < 2
* Dimpled limacon
	

1. Determine the direction and position of the curve.
2. Find the start of the curve. (I recommend thinking about the θ needed to subtract or add.)
	1. Note that these do not end on the pole, unlike the previous two.. They go past it.
	2. We were able to ignore the sign for the inner loops and outer loops BECAUSE IN ORDER TO SUBTRACT a and b, you need to go to the other side of the unit circle. r being negative will just flip it back.  This always worked because you can only have an inner loop when a/b  < 1 (so whenever b > a, where signs will change when subtracting or adding)
3. Find the end of the loop.
4. Find the other intercepts defined by `a`

`Lemniscates`
(In the form r$^2$ = a$^2$sin2θ or r$^2$ = a$^2$cos2θ )

For r$^2$ = a$^2$cos2θ,
* if a > 0, then the curve will revolve around the x-axis
* if a < 0, then the curve will revolve around the y-axis.

For r$^2$ = a$^2$sin2θ
* if a > 0, then the curve will be in the 1st and 3rd quadrants.
* if a < 0, then the curve will be in the 2nd and 4th quadrants.

a represents the length of one petal.

`When turning rectangular coordinate pairs --> polar coordinate pairs, **pay attention to the quadrants.**` `
* I.e. sin(θ) = 1/2 at two values for θ,  π/6 and 5π/6. To know which θ to choose, you need to refer to the original (x, y), identify the quadrant that the point lies in, then match that with the correct θ

To find `dy/dx` from a polar coordinate pair (r, θ) use the r equation to find y and x. Then derive those for dy/dθ and dx/dθ --> then combine and solve for `dy/dx` for the given value of θ.

And... as always, you can apply the same concepts to `dy/dx` as before: 

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfjfuVhf9DOG6_oXx1t2GJvHDfmOPQQn2okydytpcleJPT8irjexJQEn_VqMtXuaP4bpUnOC6vSbucQYdk_vstW2qAcKs2dRnl6DtkENB3kKV2xGY8YufN-6WuJG2H_Or3pYftM?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

horizontal tangency: when `dy/dx` so by extension `dy/dθ` = 0.

vertical tangency: when `dy/dx` = DNE so by extension `dx/dθ` = 0.

(Get dy/dx then set numerator and denominator = 0)

Or:

(Same thing as above, can just mash it all into one formula)

`Sketch a graph of the polar equation and find the tangents at the pole.`

The "pole" in polar coordinates refers to the origin. So, where r = 0.

5. Sketch the graph
6. set the polar equation to 0 
	* solving for the θ at the pole. "polar zeros"
7. solve for dy/dx
8. solve dy/dx for the solved θs in step 2.
