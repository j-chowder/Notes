Goal: Turn a function into their equivalent power series:

**We can do this by using the Geometric Series** as it is already in a very similar form.

To turn a function into a power series you:

1. Turn the function into a partial sum in the form a/(1 -r).

2. You then work backwards and turn the partial sum into the general Σ ar$^n$ form.
	1. Since you have the `a` and the `r` already from the partial sum.

3. Then you solve... BUT WAIT. Since we know that **geometric series converges when | r | < 1**, you just isolate | r |.

4. -1 < r < 1. Solve for r. Your interval of convergence is what is left. (It will always be open brackets because the series will not converge if r = 1, as stated by geo series.)

#### Tips for turning function --> partial sum.

* `a`  - aka numerator - can be anything. Treat that as your last priority.
*  The denominator must be in the form (1 - r). 
	* The constant MUST BE 1.
	* r can be anything. However it MUST BE subtracted.
* When you add new numbers into the function... the overall value of the function can not change. 

My PEMDAS

1.  If the function is centered at some value other than 0 (will be stated in the problem), address that first.  Usually just split up the constant value into k + c.
2. Make sure you are subtracting `r`. This usually requires factoring out negatives -- especially if `r` is not a monomial.
3. Turn the constant in the denominator into 1. Usually do this by dividing the entirety of the function by some value.
4. Throughout each step, make sure that your modified function is still equivalent to the original function.

Extra tips for centered at some `c`.

Always alter the constant so that you can smuggle a `c` value to the other side of the border.

"centered at `c`" means that **if `x` is that value, it will equal 0.** Note the general expression 
`(x - c)`
* i.e. if "centered at -2", then `c` must be +2: (x + 2)
* If "centered at 2," then `c` must be -2:  (x - 2)

* I would actually recommend this once it becomes more complicated:  determine what `c` is in `(x-c)` by setting `x` as the 'centered value.' `c` is the value that renders it equal to 0. THEN, once you have the form a/(k - (x-c)), you can determine what `k` is by expanding out `(x-c)` and comparing it to the given original function.

e.g. **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDW7wO0SBu9tg4Ps2j04Fd8ojWwVEJX0qijuSp2rx_Mr-b7RPxlGIyMTHS5QvFssAxV2rjSB0n9Q22G-q8kMmwaVRfnBy3bSZp3n8qn36PEBVDkpu7qrv1uP2Tp3LMqurtEfUmKQ?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

However, when actually doing the problem,

You will take the `c` value given in the problem FROM the constant. I.e.

`c = -2`

f(x) = 2/(6-x)

> You expand the 6 so that there can be a separate `c` value grouped with the x.

So f(x) = 2/(8 - 2 - x)

f(x) = 2/(8 - (x + 2))  

// note how the (x - c) looks. If you substitute x as the `centered value`, it will equal 0. Double check that if you expand and distribute the negatives, you will return to the original function of 2/(6-x).

#### Turning Partial Sum --> Power series

As simple as getting the `a` and the `r` value from the partial sum.

* Can get a bit nuanced though, especially since you need it to be in the form `a(x-c)^n`
	* x must be positive so always try to factor out a (-1)$^n$ . If it is in the form `(-x + c)^n`,  turn c negative.

#### Solving for Intervals of Convergence.

| r | < 1. Just solve for `r`. Again, will always be open brackets.

Ex.

Again, the interval is just | r | < 1.
* In this case, `r` is x.  `a` is all that shiz in the brackets.

* So -1 < x < 1.
* = converges at (-1, 1)

Always isolate x$^n$ so that you are able to factor it out.

Note that the Interval of convergence is just the interval where the two separate partial power series overlap.

#### Power Series Representation By Integration

Take, for example, the function 

f(x) = lnx.

To find the power series of this function, we instead need to convert it into a different form:

### f(x) = lnx = ∫(1/x)dx 

So, we are able to find the geometric power series of 1/x --> then integrate that power series, like how we did in the previous lesson. [[3.3 Power Series & Intervals of Convergence]]

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXedk-M64i2jAisFHamuOmzxG_FRQ7Lrc3HLZAErCUlmXANUpVF8VmZWmBnDtR9Fh7SsoL3T8NbRnljAlsLKYoTLsZEFHb1o1wVG-2-mkHm1TuS01mn1riqs1bIe1RA5_RcuZxdXlw?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

Now that we have found the power series of 1/x, you can substitute that into the integral:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdouzL_LmBgFZAdDptgSacLZHoIRroOLiIi6gMHZ95wFvzbVqr2zcDVRNjAC5JjzjbG37SYtJJ-H9jjHd0l5AEgbtIgIf7Xj75wl7AxcOBvUJXUYzJOKOVwm7Hn0Twgm2rYunTF?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

Take the integral and solve for C:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdydSaW-fFFa6fcNshLO7OochDNARZnyWXmArvLnvLaZENqRRjb_TVYR68O7l2yYRQEr5FDIxL_BUgHD0aUuBtkWyUv8RKs93QcqKxHWKUN9Maqukc2hBZQ9kuGpx44c71YSCUO?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

(C is found by substituting in a number for x and solving for C)

To find the endpoints and radius of convergence:

We just extract the `r` from the new power series: (x-1).

| r | < 1 =  | x - 1 | < 1

**Note that the new power series is NOT a geometric series. So technically we aren't able to use the geometric series test to solve for convergence. However, remember the properties of convergence between f(x), f'(x), and ∫f(x): the endpoints are the same.  The "r" value is the same between f(x), f'(x), and ∫f(x).**

And since the endpoints can differ between integrals and derivatives, we do need to check the endpoints for convergence. 


Now, take another function:

f(x) = tan$^-$$^1$x

Again, we can convert it into a different form to find its power series:

### f(x) = tan$^-$$^1$x = ∫(1 / (1+ x$^2$))dx


**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegLS7aQX9Q1G1UTkn-rTLRelDUAlgN2e8110Ild8Tsis5tFyg_oNZOy1Gq5oa4thO8bszbVPuQqgNsPgiuSFfQ97LKdx9gu1eeBq0KKCQxrCyCh3TgnBtfBFO0O-C6hMliferA?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

Same thing: plug the power series into the function and integrate.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe6XKuJyTs8kQ1l04-P59fQTv_Nlg31ZX8aibZnR0h0S1wrGEsROri4TpT_QNdhOEleg4Yeg-8qXynk1Aq5SesHeDRb0X0NLOLzq6-bEs3PcBVbBvQ87_QN02WD4l7GHp-qozPauA?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

AGAIN. Note that `r` for the new power series is IDENTICAL to the `r` in the original power series. 

And again. The convergence of the endpoints may or may not change: it must be tested.

Yay!!!
