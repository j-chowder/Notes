Using this basic list of Taylor series, you can derive more complicated Taylor series:

#### Complicated bases

Basically it's the same function as a "basic Taylor series" but the base is complicated or some shiz. It's not just x anymore... its x$^2$ or it's 3x or (x + 1) or some shiz.

Really easy. Just replace the corresponding x from the same basic function with the complicated base.

#### Arithmetic

A complicated function that would be a pain in the ahh to differentiate and do the standard Taylor series procedure -- you break it down into smaller pieces to make it easier.

i.e. `xsinx`. You COULD differentiate, find the nth term Taylor series polynomial, determine the pattern, then do the sigma notation.

OR

you can turn `sinx` into its Taylor polynomial... and multiply each term by `x`. That is effectively equivalent to `xsinx`. Then you can determine the pattern from there and create the sigma notation. 

By using the basic list of Taylor series sums, we are effectively skipping solving for each f$^n$(c) value and instead just turning the individual parts into Taylor series sums (that are standard and easy to derive).

#### Finding Terms via multiplication/division

**Multiplication**
Yeah you're just gonna have to do FOIL like how you would normally multiply two polynomials together. I would advise expanding out factorials since you can't multiply two factorials together to get the correct value. 

The strategy is to progressively scale... in terms of power. (since those would be the "first z terms")

i.e. first find all x terms, then x$^2$ terms, then x$^3$ terms, then x$^4$ terms etc.
* In order to do this, you don't need to stay on the the first term, you can move to the next term if that means you can multiply it to get a smaller degree x term.

**Division**
Long division.

### Tips for deriving Taylor Series (sigma notation)

Basically assume for any unknown series that n = 0. 
* this means that the polynomial that you are referring to -- in order to derive the sigma notation -- should be regarded via zero-based indexing.

Ask these questions:

1. Does the series alternate (sign)? Remember that alternating series come in the form (-1)$^n$ or (-1)$^n$$^+$$^1$. 

* No? 
	* Go to step 2.

* Yes?
	 * Now determine how the signs alternate. Is it negative on every even nth term? Does it start negative on the 1st term (n = 0), then the 3rd term (n = 2), then the 5th term. (n = 4).. etc? 
		 * (-1)$^n$$^+$$^1$
	* Or is it negative on every odd nth term? i.e. 2nd term (n = 1), 4th term (n = 3), 6th term (n = 5)... etc
		* (-1)$^n$ 

* Ok, from now on I'm going to refer to terms via their n's (so zero-based indexing).

2. Look at the n = 0 term. What is it?

* 1
	* then your main body probably is x$^k$$^n$. Since we want when n = 0 for x to equal 1. So x has to be raised to the power of 0 when n = 0.
* some x value
	* then your main body probably is x$^n$$^+$$^k$. Since we want when n = 0 for x to equal x. So x can not be raised to the power of 0 for n = 0, meaning there has to be something added to the power.
	* `k` is the power of x for the n = 0 term.

3. Look at the numerator only. How does the n value change in x$^n$ between terms?

	* Only odd values. (i.e. goes from x --> x$^3$ --> x$^5$ ...)
		* x$^2$$^n$$^+$$^1$ , provided that n = 0 term â‰  1.
	* Only even values (i.e. x$^2$ --> x$^4$ --> x$^6$...)
		* x$^2$$^n$ (if n = 0 term = 1)
		* x$^2$$^n$$^+$$^2$ (if n = 0 term = x$^2$)
	* increments + 1 each time (i.e. goes from x --> x$^2$ --> x$^3$ --> x$^4$)
		* probably just x$^n$ 

4. Is there any other shiz in the numerator? Deal with it now.
5. Do the denominator now. 

	* Factorial with only odd terms (i.e. 1! --> 3! --> 5!)
		* Then denominator is (2n + 1)!
	* Factorial with only even terms (i.e. 0! --> 2! --> 4!)
		* Then denominator is (2n)!
	* All terms
		* n!
