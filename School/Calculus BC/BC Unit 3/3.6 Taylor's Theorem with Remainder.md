#### Taylor Approximation

* Plug in a value for x in p(x) to approximate f(x).
	* Where p(x) is the Taylor polynomial
	* Where f(x) is the actual function. 

* Thus, a nth-degree Taylor polynomial for a function f solved at "a" is also the nth partial sum of the Taylor series for f at "a".   Since it refers to taking only a **finite number of terms** from the infinite series.

#### Theorem with Remainder

We basically want to know 1 thing:

**Does the Taylor series for f converge to f?**
* Which means:
	1. Does the sequence of Taylor polynomials converge?
	2. Does the remainder converge to 0.

###### f(x) = p$_n$(x) + R$_n$(x)

where 
f(x) = exact function
p$_n$(x) = approximation
R$_n$ (x) = remainder 
* again, remember that remainder is just a vague catch-all term for "everything else".

##### Does the sequence of Taylor polynomials converge?

To determine if sequence converges to f, we need the remainder R$_n$ to converge to 0. This is determined by **Taylor's Theorem with Remainder.**

Where
n is the degree of the polynomial
x is the x-value
a is where the polynomial is centered on. (Maclaurin polynomial is centered on 0 so a = 0)
c is a value between x and a: ---- a ≤	c ≤ x.

Note that this is just stating that R$_n$(x)  is equal to the maximum value of the next degree term of the Taylor series polynomial. This is very similar to the Alternating Series Remainder ([[2.x8.5 Alternating Series Remainder]]) where R$_n$ ≤ a$_n$$_+$$_1$ 

Example:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe6cNKE5Bz5v4vJt0s8ggy2-LSpvPIUNZN4yrzJXeXLqvp0O2X7vMjlyY2XhXol2zCeGXrltyfa8KxEEU60q32zvQjd2JJ81MOJF4AaXw6z1l8ns_JGXr-n8Bi5AHkhn-6DWbfIjA?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

So:
x = 1.2
c = (1.2 - 0.2) = 1
n = 2
z is a value where 1 ≤ z ≤ 1.2.

Since we do not know the exact value of "z", we can not find the exact value of the error for the approximation. Instead, we find the upper bound / maximum value of the error.

This means that we set "z" to a value that maximizes the value of f$^n$$^+$$^1$(z). 

1. Find  f$^n$$^+$$^1$(x).
   * In this example, we know that n = 2. So we are finding f$^3$(x).
2. Determine the greatest value for "z" so that f$^3$(x) is the biggest it can be within 1 ≤ z ≤ 1.2.

* Since the function has the variables in the denominator, we want z to be as small as possible to get the maximum value of f$^3$(z). Which means z = 1.

This is the maximum error value.

Note that the **maximum error value > exact error value**. 

Note that if the max  f$^n$$^+$$^1$(z) is not given or easily found, then choose 1st known reasonable value that is greater than  f$^n$$^+$$^1$(z).

General tips:

Dealing with f$^n$$^+$$^1$(z) since that seems to be the trickiest part.

1. trig functions -- like `cosx` and `sinx` are bounded in  (-1, 1). Which means the maximum value is 1.
2. the derivative of e$^x$ to any n will always be e$^x$. Now just insert `z` for the maximum value in `c < z < x`

Determining `n` for a defined p$_n$(x) taylor polynomial.

1. ALWAYS ALWAYS JUST LOOK AT THE DEGREE OF THE LAST `(x - c)` TERM.
