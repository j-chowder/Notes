##### What is a power series?

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcsiC0SOfQuDkEjx4bVe-8vtbOoSzxOSx-CUzoeP0_5Xodw4uluGPbwrTyjdmrMBqXtqWnFAQC4A2FwDvUVhan5rb0KttZoKDd-mfY6SPbAb-LZMm9Ytc76c_Yh3iAkagIHtwY6Eg?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

Clarification:

A Taylor series is a specific type of power series. In fact, **every Taylor series is a power series, and every power series is a Taylor series.**

The difference is not in what they are, **but in the context where the names are used.** Imagine it like this: Every daughter is a woman, and every woman is a daughter. The difference between "woman" and "daughter" does not lie in who is or isn't a daughter or woman - those are all the same people. The difference is that "daughter" signifies a certain relation the woman in question has to other people: If I call someone a daughter, I draw attention to the fact that her parents will be relevant in what I'm saying.

The same goes for power and Taylor series. Every power series is a Taylor series and vice versa. For every series ∑ a$_n$(x - c)$^n$ there is a smooth function f whose n-th derivative satisfies p$_n$ = f$^n$(c)/n! making that series the Taylor series of f centered at c. And every Taylor series ∑ f$^n$(c)/n! of some smooth function f is a power series with coefficients a$_n$ = f$^n$(c)/n!

But the name "Taylor series" draws attention to the fact that the smooth function f will be relevant to the context, and allows us to state the relationship between the series and the function in fewer words than if we kept referring to it as just a power series.

#### Solving for convergence of a power series

**Step 1: determine where the power series is centered at (c = ?)**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeS2XciCy-FK83rNECCumg9WWNV8HeKtDBxyUkiYGZgcH1m-K5H4QQUJ4NafPOy9E1CMQWPa2ROOVTcm9uCxzDtbZWaoKRLEvWrd7kMmjSV4uHKKJr0z5eBPK2mlIJFOvMzKZtw?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**


| c = 2  | c = 2/3 |
| ------ | ------- |
| c = -4 | c = 0   |

Tip: Just set the shiz inside of the (x)$^n$ equal to zero.

So for the top right one: 

3x - 2 = 0.
x = 2/3 = c.

**Step 2: determine radius of convergence and interval of convergence**

**3 general categories:**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfmJAplzHIAp9QfOiLTpXBDb0hOUicG0bkMuGTyGi8O5SkxmJ5uou1ifJA6OPYu0eHgneYB_BPCOv-Gv_rnW37f1vfqTWsZqqanWFPCCKUm1V2TnKz0LByyNlsHy68OjomQjmK9fQ?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

1. **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdNqZNaB5Ve98QMxmWkAbMjo9oH-BfY0h86HrpakrjWcw_x9w-n8xYBuXk6S48xE8BJhs7UTqokwRtw1mJd8UdoukekRQTNnLXgOh700WFH7TCSNnhM7HnzkWQbHDerddKPI8SAVg?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**


2. Since the limit = ∞ and because we are using the Ratio Test, the series diverges at every x-value EXCEPT FOR x = c (where the series is centered on)
	* This is because that value will make the expression n · 0 which equals 0 which, according to the Ratio Test < 1, will converge.



3. **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXePvj36lh-NAqawpssdHDvWGCv3cq2-IUSrpnCV6Wlj2DV9Ylb04VeFG5_soWT70_xRvAIaZ2NLpnHN2Ep6b16k-DwCbEX_waCyfugVOsYEBh0AxrkIh44pSxu-PsJWxaMhx3Arxg?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**
	* Then you would go about determining whether the endpoints will converge as well.


#### Step 3: Testing endpoints

* This only applies to the third example / category of power series. We know that any value in between interval of convergence ( -R + c, R + c) will result in the series converging. 

* However, it is still unknown whether or not the **endpoints** themselves will converge.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfYhBEw3RZNJWtr3CesVRahZqNbYSTPE7Wa3byFCC2zC8B-zrPm5TRlOW5equZuJyL__kIpwt-6HekcIaxDNYZE5BnkH6078gyythRyMjY9MGvA9DWrJu_f9zdHPplKmbqy6-j2?key=ziQWJHwTLKgUkvIHN9PDPw)**

R = 1.

We test if the endpoints are included in the interval of convergence by plugging in the value into the original series and then testing if it is convergent or divergent.

So the left endpoint -- 0 -- stays a parenthesis to denote that it is exclusive.

Same thing. Right endpoint -- 2 -- stays a parenthesis to denote that it is exclusive.
* Note that if it does **converge**, we denote it with a bracket. `[]`

### Differentiation and Integration (of Power Series)

Remember differentiation by power rule.

#### Finding the intervals of convergence of f(x), f'(x), and ∫f(x).

The **endpoint values** for the interval of convergence IS **THE SAME** between f(x), f'(x), and ∫f(x). The only difference is that the **inclusion** of the endpoints may or may not **differ**.

Which means that we need to **check the endpoints** each time to determine the intervals for f(x), f'(x), and ∫f(x).
