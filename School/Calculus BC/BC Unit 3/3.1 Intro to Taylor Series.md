*A Taylor series is a clever way to approximate any function as a polynomial with an infinite number of terms. Each term of the Taylor polynomial comes from the function's derivatives at a single point. The more terms in the polynomial, the more accurate it will be to the actual function*.

*Taylor Hudson series provide a way to find a polynomial “look-alike” to a non-polynomial
function.*


The first degree term, a -- matching the starting point f(0).

> p(0) = f(0).
> This would equal f(0) -- but no where else.
> Therefore, the Taylor "mono"nomial, p(x) = a, where a = f(0).

The second degree term, b -- matching the slope at the starting point f'(0).

> p'(0) = f'(0).
> This would equal f'(0).
> Therefore, the Taylor polynomial, p(x) = a + bx, where b = f'(0).
> 	With this polynomial, p(0) = f(0).  Taking the derivative, p'(x) = f'(0). So, p'(0) = f'(0).

With just two terms, our polynomial 
	(1) is equal to the function at x = 0
	(2) has the same derivative of the function at x = 0.


The third degree term, c -- matching the concavity at the starting point f''(0).

> p(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + 1/2 f''(0)x$^2$ 
> 	p(0) = f(0).
> 	p'(x) = f'(0) + f''(0)x
> 		p'(0) = f'(0)
> 	p''(x) = f''(0)
> 		p''(0) = f''(0).

Now, our polynomial has everything from the first two terms + has the same second derivative at 0 as the function.


Overall:

**Every term we add, the nth derivative of our approximation at 0 will equal the nth derivative of the function at 0.**
* 1 term = just the horizontal line
* 2 terms = tangent line
* 3 terms = concavity matches.
* 4 terms = (maybe matches the turn?)
* etc. etc.

This ultimately molds our Taylor Hudson polynomial into something that increasingly resembles the actual function.

p(x) = f$^n$(0) ⋅ x$^n$/n! --> This is the Maclaurin Series    :smiling_cat:

*Maclaurin series is just a special case of the Taylor Series that centers the x-value at 0. The Taylor Series can center at any point.*

Find the 2nd degree Maclaurin polynomial of f.

*'x degree' just means a polynomial with the biggest exponent being x. i.e. 2nd degree polynomial would mean up to x$^2$* 

p(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0) ⋅ x$^2$/2

Now solve for each individual value:

f(0) = 1

f'(x) = -1/2 ⋅ (x+1)$^-$$^3$$^/$$^2$ 
f'(0) = -1/2

f''(x) = 3/4 ⋅ (x=1)$^-$$^5$$^/$$^2$ 
f''(0) = 3/4.

^ You need to memorize these. One is guaranteed to show up on the FRQ.

* The sigma notation can easily be derived yourself; give it a go, chap!
