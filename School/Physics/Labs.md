### Ballistics Pendulum - ([[0.7 Physics Unit 7]])

* Shoot bullet at the pendulum
* Measure the vertical distance that the pendulm reaches after the collision
* Use measured masses + momentum equations + final height to calculate initial speed of the dart.

### Dart Car - ([[0.7 Physics Unit 7]])

* Shoot darts at a toy car
* Measure the distance & time it takes the car to coast after the collision
* Use measured masses + momentum equations + displacement to calculate initial speed of the dart.

### Pendulum: Calculating Gravity ([[0.10 Physics Unit 10]])
* Measure length (L) of the pendulum rope.
* Stopwatch for a period. 
	* Time it for x seconds (at least x > 10) to minimize errors. Count how many cycles it completes.
		* T = (x seconds) / (y cycles) = the time it takes to make one cycle
* Plug into T = 2π · (L/g)$^1$$^/$$^2$ 
	* g = ω$^2$ · L 

### "Tigger" Lab - ([[0.10 Physics Unit 10]])

Goal is to determine k in two different ways: 

1. Graphing k as the slope of a F vs. x line. 
	* Test various springs with differing stiffness.
		* can hang it off of a paper clip.
	* For each spring, measure its length when:
		1. it is unstretched
		2. adding a cup (measure the cup's mass)
		3. adding x amount of measurable weights.
	* F = mg -- only calculate it with added masses (spring mass is ignored).
	* x = (length after x mass is added) - (initial length of unstretched).
		* be sure to measure each trial consistently (end to end; just the spring itself, etc.); displacement (x) is determined from the different in the two lengths, so be sure that the extra distance is from **the spring stretching**.

2. Turning frequency into k.
	* Using a stopwatch (and a camera), count how many cycles the spring completes within x seconds (x > 10)
		* cycles / x = f 
	* f = (1/2π) · (k/m)$^1$$^/$$^2$ 
		* k = m · (2πf)$^2$
