#### Every physical quantity is either a scalar or a vector.

##### ==Scalar== 
- quantity that can be described by a single number (including units)
	- Is described with speed or distance.

##### ==Vector==
- a quantity that has a magnitude and a **direction** 
	- is described with velocity or displacement.

- Magnitude is the "scalar" part of a vector.
- Vectors are represented by arrows. 
	- Direction of the arrow shows direction
	- Length of the arrow indicates magnitude.

You get these angles by:
1. first identify the reference angle. This is the 2nd direction mentioned and follows "of".
2. Go that direction, then shift with the other direction.

###### Adding Vectors

==Vectors added graphically head to tail==

You can not lengthen, shorten, or rotate a vector. However, you can shift it.
To subtract a vector, switch its direction by 180$^o$ and then add head to tail.

###### Perpendicular Vectors

1. You will get one vector with the y-direction: due north or due south.
2. You will get another vector with the x-direction: due west or due east.
3. Adding them together results in the distance traveled from A to B. Which will be a diagonal and thus requires Pythagorean or triangle trigonometry to find the hypotenuse.

4. Note that to find the direction + angle for the answer, trace the tails of the base. The angle will always be of respect to the tail side. Then do arctrig.

###### Vector Components

You will need to get the respective x-components and y-components of each vector in more complex problems.
- i.e. when its not perpendicular, not colinear, or has more than 2 vectors at once.


1. Turn every vector into a right triangle to get the legs of the triangle (which will be the x and y components.)
	1. Example: if its 40 N, 70$^o$ W of S.
		1. Draw a vector going down and then a vector going left. Connect them together with the hypotenuse line.
2. Organize everything on a table so that you can add every x and y value together to find the displacement x and y value.
	1. Make sure that if the x value is going west, or if the y value is going south, that you include the **negative sign** on the table.
3. Now that you have the x and y components for R, you can solve for R using trig and Pythagorean formula.

If there are two missing vectors unknown (but angle is given) in total of 3, and they equal 0, you need to do system of equations.

###### Scalar Components

Since scalar does not include direction, concepts of north, south, east, and west must be indicated with the magnitude.
- Going west /south will be a negative number.
