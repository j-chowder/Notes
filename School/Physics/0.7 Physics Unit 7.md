#### Momentum (p)
* vector

Momentum is an `amount of motion`.
* Velocity describes the speed and direction of motion but it doesn't account for how much stuff is moving.
#### p = mv 
* Units of N • S

Combine the rate of motion and the amount of stuff moving (mass) and you get a description of how much motion there is.

Momentum, intuitively, is `how much is it going to hurt when this thing hits me?`

it tells us all sorts of stuff:
* How hard it would be to stop
* How much damage it could do on impact
* How much it will move other things on impact
* etc.

#### Impulse (F∆t)
* vector

Impulse is the `change in momentum`
## F∆t = ∆p = ∆mv 
--> Use this equation when zooming in on only **one object whose momentum is changed via an external force**

Graphically, impulse is the area underneath a force vs time graph.

Or: it is the integral of a F v t graph.

#### Collisions

Collisions occur when two (or more) objects hit each other and either bounce off or stick to each other.

Momentum is always conserved in the system. However, zooming in on a singular object, the momentum will change via an external force. 

Usually for colliding objects..
1. The colliding objects are the system
2. Forces between them are equal and opposite so they cancel each other out (internal forces)
	* Two objects bump into each other. That force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
3. Look for unbalanced external forces (that would accelerate the system.) This is called an “isolated system”

The group of the objects has a total momentum that **must always be conserved**:
* The momentum of individual objects might change upon collision -- but the momentum of the entire system as a whole will be conserved.
### P$_o$ = P$_f$ 

m$_1$v$_o$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_o$$_2$ = m$_1$v$_f$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_f$$_2$ 

**Internal forces:**
* forces between objects. These are the 'collisions'. It cannot move the center of mass of the system.
	* e.g. tension and normal force.

**External forces:**
* forces outside the system that act on the objects. 
	* e.g. gravity and friction.

#### Momentum and Kinetic Energy

Momentum (mv) is very similar to KE (0.5mv$^2$) but they're different.

> Momentum and kinetic energy both measure "how hard is it to make this object stop moving", in different ways.

> If we apply a constant force to stop it, then momentum tells us how much time we have to spend exerting that force, and kinetic energy tells us how much distance we have to travel while exerting that force.

> Momentum is the force (weight) that a moving body carries.

Any object that is moving has KE as well as momentum.

In collisions, unlike momentum, KE in the system is **not always conserved.**

1. **Elastic collision**

	* Objects bounce off each other and move in opposite directions. KE$_o$ = KE$_f$ 
	* m$_1$v$_o$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_o$$_2$ = m$_1$v$_f$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_f$$_2$ 

	* There are cases where you have to blend the above equation with KE$_o$ = KE$_f$:
	* 0.5m$_1$v$_o$$_1$$^2$ + 0.5m$_2$v$_o$$_2$$^2$ = 0.5m$_1$v$_f$$_1$$^2$ + 0.5m$_2$v$_f$$_2$$^2$ 

2. **Partially elastic/inelastic collision**

	* Objects still bounce off each other and move in opposite directions. But KE$_o$ ≠ KE$_f$ 
	* m$_1$v$_o$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_o$$_2$ = m$_1$v$_f$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_f$$_2$ 

3. **Inelastic collision**

	* Objects stick together and move in the same direction with the same velocity. KE$_o$ ≠ KE$_f$ 
	* m$_1$v$_o$$_1$ + m$_2$v$_o$$_2$ = (m$_1$+ m$_2$)v$_f$

#### Collision+ Motion after

Ties the collision problems (think p$_o$ = p$_f$) with other topics: kinematics and Unit 6 -- (E$_o$ = E$_f$ and W = ∆KE)

**The v$_f$ of the collision is the v$_o$ of the motion after.**

(Solving for the intitial velocity that the bullet was fired at. Given the height in which the pendulum reached after the collision + inelastic collision + masses.)

### Center of Mass

Relevant to momentum -- does the group’s momentum change? (Does the center of mass change/move?)

*The whole group -- has constant momentum. (until an external force to the group is applied). We are able to determine if it changes or not by determining the center of mass and its velocity.*

####  2-D problems

Since momentum is a vector, and since vectors can have x and y components, objects therefore can have **x and y momentums**. 

**Momentum is conserved in the x direction and in the y direction. So total momentum is therefore conserved.**

**Pfx = Pox and Pfy = Poy**

General info:

* Break all momentum vectors into x and y components
	* each object has 5 variables
* Think about writing an x equation and a y equation
	* just stay organized. Lowkey free. Unless you trip.

* Use triangles -- Pythagorean + triangle trigonometry.
