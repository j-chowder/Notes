#### What is oscillation?
* repetition in which they repeat themselves over and over again. 
* a back and forth motion of an object between two points of deformation.
* repeated motion back and forth on either side of an equilibrium position.

## Springs

The only springs we deal with in this class are **ideal springs**

**ideal springs**
* means no permanent deformation (not stretched too far)
* ### F  = kx
	* where F is the “pulling force” applied to the spring. (N)
		* What external force stretches the spring? What external force compresses the spring? That is your F. 
	* k = spring constant (N/m)
		* This does not change. Think of it like a friction coefficient (μ), or the gravitational constant (G). 
		* The bigger the k, the stiffer the spring is. The stiffer the spring is, the more force is needed to stretch or compress the spring. 
	* x = displacement from equilibrium position (m)
	* units of Newtons / Meter

Something to note:
* The shorter the spring, the stiffer it is.
* Cutting a spring by a constant of `x` will increase k by a constant of `x`.
	* i.e. A spring has a k of 10 N/m. If you cut it in half, the two new springs will each have a k of 20 N/m.
#### Hooke's Law
* The restoring force of an ideal spring
* #### F = -kx
	* Which, as we can see, is just the opposite of the previous equation. The restoring force acts as a reactionary force, like F$_N$, in that the greater the external force, the greater the restoring force.
	* Think of it like friction: it is ultimately a resistance to change: restoring force is the spring’s desire to get back to its unstretched position.

*You have to push/pull harder the more | x | increases because the restoring force = -kx.*

*The 'equilibrium position' is where the spring stops -- it is where the spring's restoring force balances out the exerted force. (Where the net force ∑F = 0)* 

These two equations are really just a matter of perspective. If you care about the force that the **spring is exerting to resist change,** then F = -kx will apply. If you care about the **external forces** **being exerted on the spring,** then F = kx will apply.

> e.g.
	* The work that you apply to compress a spring will be positive. (it goes down, you push down)
	* BUT, the work done by the spring force will be negative -- it is resisting your work. (it wants to go back up)

>Think raising an object → you are doing positive work, but the mg acting on the object is doing negative work. (gravity wants it to go down)

#### Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
* The oscillation is not uniform.
	* the max speed occurs at the beginning (aka the equilibrium position)
		* no force
	* slows down going away from the equilibrium position 
		* zero speed at the max distance (A) from x = 0 (as it is turning directions)
		* max force at the end 
	* speeds up going towards the equilibrium position.

* Amplitude (A) (in meters)
	* The distance from the center of motion to either extreme.
	* From the equilibrium position, what is the max distance that the oscillating object can reach? That is A.
	* In SHM, the range that that an object will go between is (e.p. - A, e.p. + A).
		* and since energy is conserved in a perfect world, the object will always reach the same height no matter how many cycles has occurred.
* Frequency (f) (in hz -- which is cycles per second)
	* Number of cycles (aka one complete repetition of the motion.) completed in one second.
		* e.g. a spring starts at the middle position (B) then goes to the extreme (C). Some peeps might say that one cycle is completed when it arrives back at B from C, but the full motion is not over: the object will now go from B to the other extreme (A). Once it reaches B again after reaching A, then one cycle has been completed. This is because it is restarting the same motion that occurred at the start: going from B to C.

* Period (T) (in sec/cycle)
	* Number of seconds to complete one cycle. 
		* T = 1/f (inverses of each other)
		* Same thing as [[0.9 Physics Unit 9]].

##### Horizontal Springs
* The equilibrium length = unstretched spring length.
	* as there are no forces on a horizontal spring to cause it to stretch or squish

##### Vertical Springs
* The equilibrium position is at the position where x = d$_o$ 
	* again, equilibrium exists where restoring force = exerted force. In this case, the exerted force is the mg pulling down on the vertical spring. This is why the equilibrium length of a vertical spring ≠ unstretched length. 
	* so, to determine d$_o$ 
		* F = kx
		* mg = kd$_o$ 

* Solving vertical spring questions with energy and work 
	1. Always solve for d$_o$ first. Everything else builds on this position. 
	2. bottom:
		* x = d$_o$ + A
		* h = 0
	3. middle:
		* x = d$_o$ 
		* h = A
	4. top:
		* x = d$_o$ - A
		* h = 2A

#### Dump of equations

The max positions, speeds, and accelerations of an object with SHM can be found with these equations:
* There is a nasty ahh proof to derive these, but I don't give two shizzes. 
* getting v is just taking the derivative of x; getting a is just taking the derivative of v.
#### x = Acosωt
* So max position = A
#### v = -Aωsinωt
* so max speed = | -Aω | = Aω
#### a = -Aω2cosωt
* so max acceleration = Aω$^2$

*Due to cos and sin being opposites, the bigger the x the smaller the v, and vice versa.*

#### Angular Velocity/Frequency (ω)
* Dare I say the two most important equations that are must-remember. 
#### ω = 2πf
* How to derive it:
	* ω = θ/t (definition of angular velocity)
	* ω = 2π/T (angular velocity = a full circle divided by the time it takes to complete one revolution)
	* f = 1/T (frequency)
	* ω = 2πf (combining the previous two)

#### ω = (k/m)$^1$$^/$$^2$ 
* How to derive it:
	* F = -kx (Hooke's Law)
	* ma = -kx (F = ma)
	* m(-Aω$^2$cosωt) = -k(Acosωt) (a = -Aω$^2$cosωt; x = Acosωt )
	* mω2 = k (simplify)
	* ω = (k/m)$^1$$^/$$^2$ (isolate ω)

And then we can combine the two if we wanted to.
#### f = (1/2π)(k/m)$^1$$^/$$^2$ 

With these equations, we can see that:
* bigger mass = bigger period = slower frequency.
* stiffer = bigger k = faster frequency = smaller period.

#### Spring Potential Energy (SPE)

#### 0.5 · k · x$^2$ 

>The more the spring stretches, the greater SPE Is (the potential energy of the spring to bounce back and slap you in the face. 
>Think of a rubber band, more you stretch the more lethal it will be when it releases (the greater the SPE is))

So long that the spring is stretched (x ≠ 0), there will be spring potential energy.

As SPE is an energy, total mechanical energy (E) is now:

KE + PE + SPE ( + RKE)

## Pendulums

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe7t0XJ3yUfwmxKNp_dR5K9AXPXEJx0E7yRRjHloqSqob1BnY6Zu4XyE7wHGhtLVktyZWO-WsTfwx65cUK8IeMJNOaIG0FsFiuLPMlmnlEXgpOjnLGggyrzTdOLksqlLX0Tml7O?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

Remember that:

arclength (s) = rθ
* For really small angles, a straight line (d) can be used to closely approximate the actual arclength.
* For pendulums, the radius is the length (L) of the pendulum (like the rope and shiz) 

Torque is what keeps the pendulum swinging. Torque is produced from gravity acting on  the pendulum.
#### τ = F(ℓ)

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdFj43dqDHC7qYp0P9jeNGT3Hpa_2-cylyhp4XaXdvlxczlzwdlJnD0EEq0u4TjrEk6hxpCVrkW5WIs7C5-FVF2a9cgPkgzog5I7cVeuMIUzUR3a-BjqGBIAkVHD9iIReoKt_qE5Q?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

#### So, τ = -mg(d)

There is this formula on the AP equation table:

#### T = (2π)(L/g)$^1$$^/$$^2$
(mathematically proves that L is the deciding factor of T)
* ONLY length of the pendulum will affect the period (so the speed in which it swings)
And we can easily derive it into:
#### ω = (g/L)$^1$$^/$$^2$ 

Yeah... pendulums are kinda the same as springs since they both abide SHM.

#### Damped Harmonic Motion
* SHM with “friction” (which will take energy away → amplitude will decrease over time)

#### Driven Harmonic Motion & Resonance
* Driving Force - force applied to an oscillating object

* Resonance - when the driving force keeps adding energy to an oscillation making the A bigger and bigger.
	* i.e. Pushing a friend on a swing you match the frequency of your pushes to the frequency of the swing.


* Natural (vibrating) Frequency - the inherent frequency at which an object or system naturally vibrates when disturbed
	* resonance occurs when the driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillating object.
