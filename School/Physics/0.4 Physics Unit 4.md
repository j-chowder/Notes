Adding concept of `forces` to kinematics.

### ∑F = ma

* ∑F = net forces (kg * m/s$^2$)
	* sum of all forces acting on an object
* m = mass (kg)
* a = acceleration (m/s$^2$)
	* you can still use kinematic equations to find acceleration, if needed.
	* Note that acceleration always points in the same direction as the net force.

Forces are found like how we calculated vectors in Unit 1. If they are collinear, you can just add head to tail. If the forces are perpendicular, you need to do Pythagorean. 
* add force vectors in the + direction; subtract force vectors in the - direction.

Mass - the amount of matter. The more mass the object, the less it wants to move. Mass is the same regardless of gravity. (Mass * gravity = weight).

* Inertia - tendency of an object to remain at rest or in motion.
* Mass is a measure of inertia.

#### Newton's 1st Law of Motion

* An object continues to remain at rest or to remain in motion at a constant speed unless acted upon by a net force.
