Basically linear kinematics (units 2 and 3) but in a circular motion.

Sign convention:

Counterclockwise is positive

Clockwise is negative.

* Revolutions can be turned to θ which is also known as angular displacement.
* Recall the formula v = 2π/T. Utilize the formula v = ωr and combine.
	* **ω = 2π/T**
* Recall the formula a$_c$ = v$^2$/r. Utilize the formula v = ωr and combine.
	* **a$_c$ = ω$^2$r**

Difference between a$_t$ and α as well as v$_t$ and ω.
* ω and α describe the rotational velocity and acceleration. This is the kinematics that focus on rotation: how fast the object is rotating in circular motion. We measure this via θ / degrees / radians (that make up a circle).

* v$_t$ and a$_t$ are the exact same as linear kinematics -- these measure how fast the rotating object is moving (in a straight line). Naturally, we measure these via meters.

* ω and α are zoomed in to the **motion within** the object, while v$_t$ and a$_t$ are more zoomed out to the **overall motion** of the object. 

Need to use vectors and right triangle to combine a$_t$ and a$_c$ to get "total acceleration".

#### Rolling Motion

The arc length traveled around the circle is equal to the horizontal displacement of the circular object.

This also means that v$_t$ and a$_t$ of the circular object is equal to the linear velocity and acceleration of the object

#### Right-Hand Rule & Direction of Angular Variables

Though we refer to circular motion using circular directions -- clockwise and counterclockwise -- there is a big flaw to using it: 

**Determining if a motion is CW or CCW is ultimately relative to your perspective.** For instance, if you draw a circle CW, a person in front of -- and facing -- you will consider the motion CCW.

Since we need to know direction for signs of ω and α, we need a way to normalize direction without making it confusing: hence **the right-hand rule:**

Use your **right** hand so that your fingers curl in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). The **curl** of your fingers mimics the motion. If the direction is drawn on the y plane, point the thumb on the x-axis (right, left, front, back) If the direction is drawn on the x-plane, the thumb will point up or down.

Your thumb is the direction of the force vector of ω and/or α. This force vector does not actually exist -- its sole purpose is to normalize direction and thus sign.

##### *When you're so horny that you want to put your axle into a girl and then relate F$_c$ = ma$_c$ to the ω, α, and θ of her insides. Then calculate the hypothetical tangential velocity and acceleration before you realize you have to measure the radius of her womb. Then finally using the Right Hand Rule while you're beating your meat to realize that the force vector of angular velocity and acceleration points to South South West.*
