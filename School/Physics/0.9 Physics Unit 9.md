#### Torque

>*a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Just as force is what causes an object to accelerate in linear kinematics, torque is what causes an object to acquire angular acceleration.*

Lever arm (ℓ)
* the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is applied.
* Torque is produced when there is a force that points perpendicular to the lever arm. 
* Basically locate the force vector and the axis of rotation / hinge. ℓ is the perpendicular distance from the force vector's path to the hinge.

## τ = F ⋅ ℓ
* Recommended when the entire object is tilted with an angle.

or:
## τ = Fsinθ ⋅ r
* where r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the force.
* I say `sinθ` but note that this is a generalization: what we want is just the component of the force that is **perpendicular** to the axis of rotation. It can be either cosθ or sinθ depending on where θ is located.
* Recommended when the object is completely flat.

Torque (τ) has units of N ⋅ m and is a vector.
* Not the same as joules. Torque is force at a distance. Work is force through a distance. Same unit dimensions, different measurements. Torque is a vector quantity, where as energy is a scalar quantity.

Sign conventions:
* Since torque is all about rotational shiz:
	* CCW is positive.
	* CW is negative.
* To easily determine direction, have your finger act as the rotational axis and apply forces accordingly.

Note:
* Since torque can only be generated with a force (or a force component) that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, a force directly on the hinge will generate zero torque.

#### Equilibrium

For all systems in equilibrium, ΣF$_x$ = 0, ΣF$_y$ = 0, Στ = 0.

General steps for solving these problems:

1. Draw FBD of object
	 * Include weight(s)
	 * Include applied force(s)
	 * Include x force(s) at each support
	 * Include y force(s) at each support.

2. Apply ΣF$_x$ = 0, ΣF$_y$ = 0

3. Apply torque = 0.
	* Rotation point does not matter. Choose one that will help you eliminate unknowns to be able to solve for variables.
	* Sometimes force vectors can be ambiguous, so we need to test. torque = 0 is used to solve for those vectors → so you need to assume the direction → which you can double check with the signs after solving. (- means opposite; + means correct).

#### Moment of Inertia (I)

## τ = Iα
* Derivation
	* F = ma
	* τ/r = m(rα)
	* τ = mr$^2$α
	* τ = Iα

I has the units kg ⋅ m$^2$ 
* Derivation
	* τ = Iα
	* N ⋅ m = I(rad/s$^2$)
		* turn into units
	* (kg ⋅ m / s$^2$)  ⋅ (m) = I(rad/s$^2$)
		* expand N 
	* I = kg ⋅ m$^2$ 

You can think of `τ = Iα` as `f = ma`; everything in `τ = Iα` is just a rotational variant of `f = ma`
* torque (τ) is a force that produces rotational acceleration
* α is rotational acceleration
* I is a resistance to rotational movement, just like how m is a resistance to linear movement.
#### I = mr$^2$
* (the moment of inertia for a point mass)
* where m is the mass of the object
* where r is the distance between the object and the axis of rotation.
* This is the only formula for I that you need to memorize.

> Moments of inertia depend on more than just mass of the object: it depends on the shape, location, and orientation of the object relative to the axis of rotation. How the weight is **distributed relative to the axis** will determine how hard something is to rotate: it determines the I of the object.
> 	*i.e. if there is more mass further away from the axis, it is harder to spin the object. (bigger I)*

**Parsing Word Problems**

* "All the mass of `x` is located at the same distance from the axis"
	* Definition of a point mass. Use the formula for it.

* "Objects connected by massless `x`" *proceeds to give you the length of x*
	* More often than not a point mass.

> If the object is NOT TOUCHING the axis of rotation, it is often a point-mass. The question will often give you the distance between the axis and the object; not the radius/length of the object.

* "An object that has the shape of `x`"
	* use the moment of inertia formula for `x`. 
	* i.e.
		* "The axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the disk at its center"
			* You are using the formula for a disk with the axis going straight through the middle.

> if there are multiple objects sharing the same axis of rotation, you can add their individual I's together to find the total I of the system.

#### Rotational Kinetic Energy (RKE)
## 0.5Iω$^2$

RKE is basically just KE but rotational.

Total mechanical energy (E) is now equal to:

0.5mv$^2$ + mgh + 0.5Iω$^2$ + (0.5kx$^2$)

>Rotational kinetic energy and linear kinetic energy can sometimes be the same thing -- it is just a question of perspective.
>	The formula rω = v$_t$ is used to account for this.

Take two different examples:

**Rolling objects:**
* This one would naturally have both rotational KE and translational KE 
	* it is spinning, and it is also traversing (down a hill or some shiz)
* Can substitute v in mv2 to rω or vice versa to put everything as one variable.
* using rω = vT
	* i.e. if you want to solve for linear speed at the end, turn everything into v. 
	* if you want to solve for rotational speed at the end, turn everything into ω.

> Doing these problems and using these formulas will mathematically prove that:
> 	greater I = smaller v$_t$
> 	mass and radius does not affect speed.

**Orbiting Objects:**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXezMBaQP2XaL_zUgnyVhQ4yD-lnBot-5jmY1dMARTI7E-_dVNk2VWJ056lzfamtRwSONjxBuNoOXUj7acN2rX_zm0J3EXspbiQePYG1YBUM5um3OxRGZmpJvGYMF3agdhVM97J0sA?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

This is an example where (assuming the satellite itself isn't spinning for some reason) RKE and KE are the same thing... depending on how you look at it:

* Satellite in isolation
	* Alright, it's just moving in a circular path. That's v$_t$ so there will be translational KE.

* Satellite orbiting around a **planet**
	* in this case, the planet is the same as the axis of revolution, and the satellite orbiting is the same as it revolving around that axis.
	* Therefore, the speed at which the satellite orbits the planet can be interpreted as angular frequency (ω).

Note that depending on which way you interpret the problem, both come out to be the same. But you wouldn't include both RKE and KE; it's one or the other.

#### Rotational Work
## W$_R$ = τ rθ
Rotational work is work done in a rotational direction, or basically the energy that is involved in spinning something

---
#### Angular Momentum
## L = Iω 

Conservation of momentum also applies to angular momentum:
#### **L$_o$ = L$_f$

> Note that conservation of L (angular momentum) does not necessarily imply conservation of energy, just like how conservation of linear momentum does not necessarily mean conservation of energy.

**General Tips**

Multiple Objects
* "rotate as a single unit" 
	* they share the same ω and the total I is made up of the I's of the individual objects.
		* i.e. (I$_a$ + I$_b$)ω
* person on top of a carousel
	* they share the same ω.
		* think a penny on top of a record spinner -- its angular frequency = the angular frequency of the record.
		* or think a person in a car. Their linear velocity is the same as the car's velocity.

changing shapes
* I$_o$ ≠ I$_f$ as the distribution of weight has changed.
