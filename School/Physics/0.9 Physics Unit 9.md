#### Torque

>*a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Just as force is what causes an object to accelerate in linear kinematics, torque is what causes an object to acquire angular acceleration.*

Lever arm (ℓ)
* the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is applied.
* Torque is produced when there is a force that points perpendicular to the lever arm. 
* Basically locate the force vector and the axis of rotation / hinge. ℓ is the perpendicular distance from the force vector's path to the hinge.

## τ = F ⋅ ℓ
* Recommended when the entire object is tilted with an angle.

or:
## τ = Fsinθ ⋅ r
* where r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the force.
* I say `sinθ` but note that this is a generalization: what we want is just the component of the force that is **perpendicular** to the axis of rotation. It can be either cosθ or sinθ depending on where θ is located.
* Recommended when the object is completely flat.

Torque (τ) has units of N ⋅ m and is a vector.
* Not the same as joules. Torque is force at a distance. Work is force through a distance. Same unit dimensions, different measurements. Torque is a vector quantity, where as energy is a scalar quantity.

Sign conventions:
* Since torque is all about rotational shiz:
	* CCW is positive.
	* CW is negative.
* To easily determine direction, have your finger act as the rotational axis and apply forces accordingly.

Note:
* Since torque can only be generated with a force (or a force component) that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, a force directly on the hinge will generate zero torque.

#### Equilibrium

For all systems in equilibrium, ΣF$_x$ = 0, ΣF$_y$ = 0, Στ = 0.

General steps for solving these problems:

1. Draw FBD of object
	 * Include weight(s)
	 * Include applied force(s)
	 * Include x force(s) at each support
	 * Include y force(s) at each support.

2. Apply ΣF$_x$ = 0, ΣF$_y$ = 0

3. Apply torque = 0.
	* Rotation point does not matter. Choose one that will help you eliminate unknowns to be able to solve for variables.
	* Sometimes force vectors can be ambiguous, so we need to test. torque = 0 is used to solve for those vectors → so you need to assume the direction → which you can double check with the signs after solving. (- means opposite; + means correct).
