#### *Work is the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is displaced.*

Or: *Work is giving / taking away energy to a system.*
### Work = Force(distance) = F · S

W (work, not weight) is a scalar quantity with units of J = Joules = N ⋅ m.

* It's important to note that only the force component **parallel** (or colinear) to the object's motion does **work**.
	* So, in reality, W = (Fcosθ)s
		* analyzing the θ of the vector, we can see that the more vertical the vector is, the smaller `force` is (remember cosθ and how that works on unit circle).

* Distance and direction is important
	* If the object you push does not move, you are not giving or taking work. (`s` = 0).
	* What determines if you are applying positive or negative work is dependent on the motion of the object.

		* θ is ultimately dependent on the angle between the `force` vector and the `s` vector.
		* (Again, think of cosx function)
			* If 0 < θ < 90°, work is positive. 
			* If 90° < θ < 180°, work is negative.
			* If θ = 90°, work = 0.
				* This should make sense. If the object's motion is on the x-axis, and the force vector is applied on the y-axis, it won't affect the horizontal motion.
			* If θ = 0 or 180°, Fcosθ = ±F.
				* If the object's motion is on the x-axis, and the force vector is on the x-axis, then every little bit of it will affect the motion.
* Note if the question says the force is 'perpendicular' to the motion or some shiz... THATS THEM TELLING YOU θ IS 90° which means work of that force = 0.

E.g.

* Bench Press
	* Pushing up = positive work by arms. (motion is up. force is up, thus θ = 0)
	* Lowering the bar = negative work by arms ( motion is down, force is up thus θ is 180).

* Pushing a wall
	* The wall doesn't budge. There is **no work** being applied to the wall, even if you are exerting force. 
	* You start to move. The force that you exert is now work being applied to yourself.

* Friction
	* Always negative work, since friction opposes motion.

#### Net / Total Work

Net / Total work is the net amount of work when multiple forces are at play.

You can find the total work done by either using the net force(∑F) on the object or by adding the two work numbers.

Note that finding total work by adding individual components of work WILL ALWAYS BE A SUM. 
* You don't dictate the sign of the work, cosθ does. if it's cos(90 < θ < 180) (force vector points in the opposite direction of the motion vector), IT WILL INHERENTLY BE NEGATIVE.

#### 6.2 Work Energy Theorem and Kinetic Energy.

Kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because of its motion.

Kinetic energy = KE = 1/2mv$^2$ 
* units of J.

The **total** work done on an object changes its kinetic energy.

#### Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)

Potential Energy - Energy that has the potential to be converted into Kinetic Energy, if allowed.

GPE - Energy that an object has based on its height above the ground (or another surface).

It represents the potential an object has to do work as a result of being located at a particular position in a gravitational field.
* Basically: gravity wants to pull the object down to Earth --> If it does, how much will be converted to KE? (As in how fast will it move?) The energy that has the potential to be converted into Kinetic Energy due to gravity... that's the GPE.

Note:

The object itself does not "contain" potential energy. It's the "system" that the object resides in... that contains the potential energy.

A ball at the top of a hill has more Potential Energy than a ball at the bottom of a hill, *specifically* because the ball is being acted on by Earth's gravity. Because gravity is pulling down on the ball, it has the "potential" to gain kinetic energy. Also, balls don't just pop into existence at the top of hills; presumably some other agent spent energy to lift the ball up against the force of gravity and put it on top of the hill, and that energy spent should be equal to the potential energy it has now. So, in some sense, the energy isn't "in" the ball at all, it's an emergent property of the system (the ball, the Earth's center of gravity, the hill exerting a Normal Force so the ball can't fall straight down, etc.)

### GPE = mgh.
(gravity * height)
* Note that the greater the height, the greater the GPE. Which makes sense... with more airtime, the object is able to accelerate more and more -- and get faster and faster -- and thus gain more and more KE. So, there is a greater GPE that can convert to KE.

### ΔPE = mg(h$_f$ - h$_0$)

### Wgravity = mg(h$_0$ - h$_f$)

Work by gravity and ΔPE are inverses. 
* Think throwing something up:
	* Motion up
		* Gravity vector opposes motion. Work by gravity will be negative.
		* The object is slowing down, so KE → PE. Δ in PE is positive.
	* Motion down
		* Gravity vector parallels the motion. Work by gravity will be positive.
		* The object is speeding up, so PE → KE. Δ in PE is negative.

You can memorize these formulas... or just use your brain. An object slowing down means that KE --> PE. So +ΔPE. And there needs to be energy taken away for it to slow down: -W

An object speeding up means that PE --> KE. So -ΔPE. And there needs to be energy given for it to speed up: +W

#### Total Mechanical Energy

Total mechanical energy (E) = KE + PE.

### E = KE + PE = 0.5mv$^2$ + mgh.

Remember that work is the transfer of energy.

So, we could say that the transfer of energy (W) = the change in total mechanical energy (ΔE)

Or 
### W$_n$$_c$ = ΔE = E$_f$ - E$_0$ 

If we expand it even more:

### W$_n$$_c$ = (0.5mv$_f$$^2$ + mgh$_f$) - (0.5mv$_0$$^2$ + mgh$_0$)

Or rearranging:
### W$_n$$_c$ = (0.5mv$_f$$^2$ - 0.5mv$_0$$^2$ ) + (mgh$_f$ - mgh$_0$) = ΔKE + ΔPE 


*W$_n$$_c$ is the total work of all nonconservative (nc) forces.*

Tips:

* Always try to set one of the `h` as 0. (remember that it is displacement: h$_0$ and h$_f$ are relative differences of one another. You can always set one to be 0)
* The maximum height in vertical motion is when v$_y$ = 0. (relative maximum -- change in direction).

* Whether you throw an object directly up, directly horizontal, diagonal, or even directly down, the velocity when it reaches the ground will be the same, provided the initial velocity is the same.

Compare two places and the object's motion between them:
* Determine if E$_f$ = E$_0$. Does the object lose energy? Gain energy?
	* i.e. does it slow down? Does it come to a stop? Does it climb a hill?

#### Power

*how fast something can do work*
#### Pavg = Work/time = w/t 
##### Watts = Joules/sec = J/s

Alternate forms:
#### Pavg = F(cosθ)s/t = ΔKE = Fˉv

#### ˉv = v$_a$$_v$$_g$ = 0.5(v$_0$ + v).

As power can be expressed via multiple equations, look at the units / variables that you are given to determine what variation of the equation to use.
