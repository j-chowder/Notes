#### Uniform Circular Motion

* motion in a circular path at a constant speed. 

Important things to know about circles:

* The circumference of a circle is 2πr. 
* A revolution means going around in a circle once.
	* i.e. going the length of the circumference.
* Arc lengths are sections of a circle's circumference.
* Tangent lines intersect a circle only once.
	* Tangent lines and radii make a right angle.

---
### Period = "time"

* Time to go around a circular path once.
* Time for one revolution.
* Time to travel the length of the circumference.
* Units of "seconds/revolution" or "minutes/revolution" (or just "sec" or "min")

* The inverse is "Revolutions per minute" (RPM).

To turn RPM --> Period (T)

1200 rpm --> T

1/1200 rpm. x 60 seconds/minute = 0.05 seconds/revolution.

---

Even though the speed is constant, velocity is constantly changing.
* Since speed is without direction, but velocity has direction. And direction constantly changes to keep the object moving circular.

### V = 2πr/T.

Since velocity is constantly changing, acceleration exists:

a$_c$ = centripetal (center-seeking) acceleration.

When v and r are independent of each other:

### a$_c$ = v$^2$/r

When v is dependent on r:

### a$_c$ = 4π$^2$r/T$^2$

* Basically use this equation when velocity is not given but radius and period is.


---
### Centripetal Force (F$_c$)

F =  ma 
F$_c$ = ma$_c$ 

F$_c$ = mv$^2$/r

Note that F$_c$ is just the net force keeping an object moving in a circular path. It is not a new, unique force. It is composed of all the other forces summing each other out: T, F$_n$ , f, applied, mg.

The sign convention is:
* Moving towards the center is positive.
* Moving away from the center is negative.

Again, for all 4 examples, F$_c$ is an unbalanced force pointing to the center of the circular path.

Friction for circular motion:
* Remember Newtons Law of Motion : "a body in motion will remain in motion unless it is acted upon by an external force."
	* what this means is that when something is spinning circularly fast enough (with contact to a surface below), it wants to fly off in a straight (tangent) line due to inertia.

* Car turning
	* the wheels are being kept in place by static friction so the car does not skid.
	* **![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdAjbRkeWN6ErwPx_IpOhNowf0WX33_r2E-Y0twGZF0LHcIpRcxmKFjwC5XbYTbaU6aIFIT_8lM5ZEVO2dAehpuWuBuQeALrIgK_vIFXq9K0w8Ln8KMpQ0_D-vPO3AYTmqns3f9qx0XIGcn2uln6LIRYzg?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**
	* so the direction that the car moves = where the friction points since the tires move in the opposite direction.
	*  (If you can't visualize this, think of what happens when you row a boat. You push the paddles backward so that the water resistance force pushes your boat forward)

	* As you negotiate a turn, if you are turning left, your wheels are pushing to the right against the floor. Static friction allows the floor to "push back" against your wheels, allowing you to turn left.

* Object sliding on floor
	* Remember the difference between static and kinetic friction.
		* kinetic friction "slows" down an object's motion
		* static friction "prevents" an object's motion.
	* So, the centripetal force static friction is preventing the object from sliding outward.
		* which means that the static friction is keeping the object towards the center rather than away from the center.

#### Banked turns

*A banked turn is a turn or change of direction in which the vehicle banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.*

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdrm42FHxxs1ZKC_nd2-INSXKyL5DFXPDVncsfYGgJfZOLswx6iSRwJ2wczr1g35hjEZ5yCbnN3kFvOxNog6r2XVtlq-S2t3qvfhVspC4wBpP2vRcA5U0cqSWuqk_0wh4S6PiTfLA?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

The road being banked causes a component of F$_N$ to be pointing towards the center of the turn (which = F$_c$).

1. F$_c$ = ma$_c$

2. F$_N$sinθ = mv$^2$/r

In terms of F$_y$ 

1. F$_N$cosθ - mg = 0
2. F$_N$cosθ = mg.
3. F$_N$ = mg/cosθ. 

--> Combining both equations:

tanθ = v$^2$/gr

#### Satellites in Circular Orbit.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcG9SKFf0VzpePWcT1uAhzc7rKfWgXjASvFtux039U1IGsuBniuZrbzRy5iZwXIwNidnXedIRGljWiXF6YTyfes2KCJTPY8RaWEYZhKJ-KjMbdy2lzQtdFUnwEFZoTtIVDuck3QPA?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**



Gravitational force is the centripetal force that keeps the satellite in orbit.

The yellow outer circle is the orbital path: so the "r" (radius) is from the middle to the orbit path.
* which often means `radius of Earth + h`

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdbuYxi3h2V7pqnr8sxeHbc8HrxFu6QFdtPN09yEUQuiLcMQr8s4EJxKtGZJcp1b9McxwvcZZ6q5PFgR0g7uqiqdfYqHBSEn22ZdEe87ttK7jhnCJNvI_Zv-PiMfdEEa9wjZxXbWg?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

If we examine the equation + logically thinking:

There is only **one** speed that a satellite can have to remain in orbit with a fixed radius.

* The force of gravity can not be changed (except through distance). So, if speed changes, the force of gravity must change. The only way that can happen is through changing the radius. 

* the further the satellite is from the planet (bigger the r), the slower it is (smaller the v). Which makes sense -- further distance = weaker pull + attraction.
* the closer the satellite is to the planet, (smaller r), the faster it is (bigger the v). Closer distance = stronger pull + attraction.

#### Apparent Weightlessness

Take the FBD of a person in an elevator:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcDdEgiUUSwPBxkIBAJQvGVbh8wtR9u2MRwY_mVrV2RZUU6qNfcqwZnU-vsmQYHSR8EO4yQ19DQCre2IHRbFkCX2mviQdl0p_5Xyx2vVPQaUFd3p8pPquNh4VeABcUa4ff7Ff5uyA?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

When would a = -9.8 m/s$^2$?

When the rope holding up the elevator is cut: when the elevator enters free fall.

* Elevator is now in free fall → you are now in free fall. 

Conceptually:

It makes sense that F$_N$ = 0, you're not touching anything after all -- so nothing is applying normal force on you.

---
#### Artificial Gravity.

In space there's no gravity. Astronauts might want gravity -- to exercise or some shiz. So we can "create" artificial gravity:

We do this by spinning the shuttle/satellite the astronauts are in -- which generates centripetal acceleration, and thus centripetal force.

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdqbgtHLFxlLAY5UiJkX3pI_i7erWyXKR0MUiUs1r6yZTjMxgXV99T3q2vdFGzmwSRT-OzlCxza-QnOkuTdnSnrPfntM9Y4705Pm0lyzW4DvjDHtpAZ0_3XAgwMtoJ2wU_wGuTROg?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

F$_N$ is the F$_c$ --> remember that F$_N$ is the apparent weight of the object which is the "weight" / how heavy the object appears to be.
* The faster it spins and the bigger the radius, the more F$_N$ there is. == the heavier the object feels.

F$_N$ = mv$^2$/r

* remember that we are trying to recreate gravity so that the object can "weigh" a certain amount.
* Therefore, we weigh "mg" (mass x gravity) newtons.

So we would replace F$_N$ with a certain "g" to provide a certain "mg" to produce a certain "apparent weight".

i.e.

mg = mv$^2$/r (setting F$_N$ as mg) means that the object "weighs" the same amount on earth.

Further simplifying the equation:

sqrt(gr) = v.

Things to note:
* We are zooming in to an object/person inside the satellite spinning. The satellite itself is the circle that is providing the UCM.
* Zooming out, the satellite (and the people inside it) are orbiting a planet -- which is also another example of UCM (where gravity/attraction is the F$_c$).

* The whole satellite/shuttle is spinning together with the same period, however different parts will have different radii (and therefore different velocity).
	* This means that you could solve for different values of r and v with the same T.


---
#### Satellite Period 

(This only applies to UCM)

Take the equation of the speed of a satellite with a constant radius:
#### v = sqrt(GM$_E$/r)

And take the equation of speed in uniform circular motion:
#### v = 2πr/T

Now set them equal:

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQqCQlwHLm37Yn9-b2QLhnFrkk7LEoC2IinuhMEMnHWhguaAdwzUq3KXF6EZZdbqJJ3hQICMIlGhz3h9lw6ZimyR6Dr_D7slsMy4CutKIBAgX2OSvTB9W66XwSEN4zXSvtBBBBog?key=wU0TCv51ywcp8rTBstNNUPwF)**

###### Geosynchronous (or just "synchronous") Satellites.

Basically means that they have the same period as Earth (1 day).

Ex:

#### Vertical Circular Motion

(Inside the circle)

Where F$_n$ is interchangeable with T

The object in circular motion is lightest at C.

* Since F$_n$ = mv$^2$/r - mg.
	* (smaller F$_n$ = lighter you are.)

The object is heaviest at A
* Since F$_n$ = mv$^2$/r + mg.

(Outside the circle)
